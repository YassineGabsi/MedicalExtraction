11,Diseases of the digestive system,"Diseases of oral cavity, salivary glands and jaws",Development of a preference based child-centred measure of dental caries suitable for use in economic evaluation,"Tooth decay (caries) is a common disease worldwide, and can cause children to have toothache, problems sleeping, eating, speaking and having to take time off school. Dental decay is the most common reason for children to be admitted to hospital, and costs the NHS around Â£3.4 billion each year. The NHS has a limited amount of money and demand for services is continually increasing. Decision-makers have to choose which treatments to fund, considering whether they are value for money (cost-effective). This means the costs and benefits are compared. In dentistry, there is no measure that can be used to work out and compare the effectiveness of treatments for children's teeth. This means that decisions about funding of dental services for children with tooth decay are not well informed. A questionnaire that can work out the effectiveness of treatments and is suitable for children to complete themselves is needed. Seeking childrenâs opinions tells us which aspects of tooth decay matter to children most, so that treatment decisions relate to what is actually important to them.  This project intends to adapt a questionnaire called CARIES-QC with children's involvement, to make it suitable to test the benefits of different dental treatments for tooth decay. The questionnaire will be made up of activities, or tasks, for children to complete to see how they would rate different features of tooth decay. This project also aims to find out which type of task is most suitable for children to complete independently, as well as how many tasks children can manage and which age range of children can complete them. I will share the results of this project with everyone involved, the public, other healthcare professionals, and decision makers, and the new measure will be made available from the university website for use in future research.","Stage 1  Inclusion criteria:  â¢ children aged 5- to 16-years;  â¢ children with active dental caries, including if in conjunction with Molar Incisor Hypomineralisation (MIH);  â¢ children who are able to understand spoken English, i.e. able to understand and undertake the research with support;  â¢ children with parents/ caregivers who are able to understand spoken English, i.e. can understand the research with support.

4,"Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases",Metabolic disorders,Experiences and Practices of Treatment for Alkaptonuria in UK healthcare: A Sociological Study,"Alkaptonuria (also known as Black Bone Disease or Black Urine Disease, and sometimes abbreviated to AKU) is an inherited metabolic disease causing severe and early onset osteoarthritis among other debilitating symptoms. It is an ultra-rare condition, estimated to affect between 1 in 250,000 and 1 in 1,000,000 people. Continuing progress within metabolic medicine and therapeutic advances develops new and improved ways of treating alkaptonuria. Recent developments in the UK in particular have made it more likely that patients with the condition will be offered specialised healthcare based on the latest medical evidence as well as the option to take part in ongoing clinical trials. Although these are significant developments, knowledge about the experiences and practices of treatment for alkaptonuria in UK healthcare remains limited to case reports and anecdotal accounts. At this key juncture, a better understanding of this is needed to inform future progress in clinical practice and service provision. This study aims to advance this evidence base. Conducted over 15 months this sociological study will use qualitative methods including interviews, participant observation and document analysis with 60 participants (patients, carers, healthcare and non-governmental organisation (NGO) staff). The study is expected to help us to identify new approaches to treatment, or ways in which existing approaches could be improved and/or changed. This will provide an important resource that could benefit future service users and providers. In addition, the research aims to uncover results which could be beneficial for the treatment of other medical conditions in UK healthcare, by exploring the extent to which findings can be defined as specific to alkaptonuria, distinct to rare diseases, and shared with more common diseases. The study is sponsored by the University of Cambridge, and is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust.","Inclusion criteria for all participants     â¢ Aged 17 years or over.   This lower age limit across sample groups is required as potential participants must be capable of giving consent on their own behalf to participate in this research. In line with HRA guidance, people over 16 can be presumed to have this capability. In addition, 17 is the age from which patients with alkaptonuria can attend the National Alkaptonuria Centre. As a particular focus of this study is researching experiences and practices of treatment at this clinic, this is a suitable criterion for the lower age limit for patient participants.  â¢ Either in, or not in, the process of receiving, providing or supporting treatment at the National Alkaptonuria Centre.   As already outlined, although this study will focus on treatment at the National Alkaptonuria Centre, treatment for alkaptonuria elsewhere in UK healthcare is a principle parallel interest, hence the reason for this criterion.    Additional inclusion criteria for specific sample groups    Inclusion criteria for patients    â¢ Diagnosis of alkaptonuria      Inclusion criteria for key individuals     â¢ Nominated by patient participants as key individuals in their care (e.g. carers - partners, family, friends; healthcare or NGO staff)       Inclusion criteria for healthcare or NGO staff    â¢ Experience of treating patients with alkaptonuria or supporting patients with alkaptonuria with their treatment"
2,Neoplasms,"Malignant neoplasms of eye, brain and other parts of central nervous system",BRAcED: A qualitative study of patient perspectives on factors affecting timely diagnosis of primary brain tumours,"In the UK, nearly 10,000 new brain, other CNS and intracranial tumour cases are diagnosed annually. Despite accounting for â¤2% of all primary cancers, brain cancer is responsible for 7% of cancer deaths before age 70, with an average of >20 years of life lost per patient. NCIN data on routes to diagnosis show that between 2006 and 2013, 61% of within-brain tumours were diagnosed following emergency presentation, with only 1% diagnosed following two-week urgent referral for suspected cancer.  Emergency presentations to specialist care are more likely to include multiple symptoms, and despite a faster time from presentation to surgical intervention and histological diagnosis, are associated with a poorer overall survival. There is thus a need for improving diagnosis of adult brain tumours in primary care. The effectiveness of the Head-Smart campaign in improving diagnosis of paediatric brain tumours through a combined approach, including a detailed understanding of early symptoms, to increase awareness and drive service change has established an important precedent for this rationale.  Little is known about the processes of symptom detection and help-seeking decisions of patients presenting with brain tumour symptoms.   Aim:   This qualitative study aims to improve understanding and ultimately streamline timely diagnosis of brain cancer by exploring the total diagnostic interval (TDI) from the perspective of patients recently diagnosed with a primary brain tumour. Method: The study consists of two stages:  (1) Qualitative in-depth interview study of up to 40 adult patients recently diagnosed with a primary brain tumour to develop a richer understanding of patient experiences, symptoms, and decision-making along the pathway to diagnosis.  (2) Findings arising from analysis of the interviews will be presented at a stakeholder workshop to discuss their implications policy, practice and future research and to validate, refine and optimise recommendations for dissemination and publication.",All patients aged 18 and over and radiologically diagnosed with a primary brain tumour will be eligible for potential inclusion unless their diagnosing clinician indicates they are not suitable or too unwell.
9,Diseases of the circulatory system,Other forms of heart disease,"Validating the accuracy of novel, non-contrast, Cardiac magnetic resOnaNce imaging in defining myocardial FIbRosis in patients with end-stage renal disease on haeModialysis: the CONFIRM study.","Patients on dialysis have abnormally high rates of heart problems which are related to the development of scarring in the heart muscle. Being able to accurately measure this scarring is important in terms of understanding how the disease progresses, being able to measure the response to new treatments and, for example, assessing suitability for transplantation. This study will assess how well a new cardiac MRI technique measures fibrosis in the hearts of dialysis patients by comparing scans directly to heart tissue obtained from patients who have donated their hearts for research following their death.    There are currently no good ways of measuring levels of scarring in the hearts of patients with advanced kidney disease and patients on dialysis, but recent work we have completed in Leicester has shown a new cardiac MRI technique may be able to determine levels of scarring in the hearts of patients on dialysis (native T1 mapping). To assess the accuracy of this technique in dialysis patients, it is essential to undertake a study which compares native T1 mapping to actual levels of scarring in the hearts of patients on dialysis.     With the help of extensive work with our dialysis patient and public involvement group this study plans to approach dialysis patients nearing the end of their lives, identified through the local, Leicester dialysis supportive care register, to discuss the possibility of them undertaking a cardiac MRI scan for measurement of levels of scarring in their hearts using native T1 mapping and then consenting to donate their heart after death to allow direct comparison between the scans we conduct and the levels of scarring in their heart that we find.",1.

11,Diseases of the digestive system,Noninfective enteritis and colitis,PoPSTER: Patient preferences and current Practice for adults with STERoid resistant ulcerative colitis - A mixed methods study,"Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is a lifelong Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) where people develop ulcers in the lining of the colon (also known as the large bowel). UC has many painful symptoms and has a big impact on quality of life. People with this disease may have long periods of remission (good health) but many will have relapses where their symptoms get worse. Steroids are one of the potential treatments for UC, but this is only effective for about half of people with this condition, the other half can be described as âsteroid resistantâ.     A number of other treatments are recommended for use in this country, but the supporting research evidence is limited. For example, there are no direct âhead-to-headâ comparisons and it is often not clear whether the people who took part in these studies were resistant to, or dependent on steroids. To confuse matters, there is no agreed definition of steroid resistance in this patient group.      The aim of the research is to investigate how adults with steroid resistant UC are being managed in secondary care, and how current practice compares with patient and clinician preferences.     We plan to do this by:   1. Conducting a questionnaire study of IBD healthcare professionals from across the UK.   2. Interviewing healthcare professionals to find out about their clinical practice.   3. Interviewing patients about their views on different treatment options and how they make decisions about those.   4. Carrying out a questionnaire study of patients and healthcare professionals to work out their preferences for treatment options.   5. Bringing together healthcare professionals and patients to review the findings from our study, to help develop ideas for future research and treatments.     The outputs of our study can be used to design a large scale randomised controlled trial for steroid resistant UC in the future.","Patient inclusion criteria:     1) Aged 18 years or older;  2) Have the capacity to give fully informed consent;  3) Have ulcerative colitis extending beyond the rectum;  4) Have active disease at the time of participation or have previously had active disease successfully treated with steroids.     Healthcare professional inclusion criteria:    Healthcare professionals that are a member of a medical, nursing or Allied Health Professional staff with a specialist ineterest or expertise in providing care to patients with IBD (particularly ulcerative colitis) within an NHS Trust in the UK. A membership to the IBD section of the BSG and RCN IBD Nurses Network indicates their interest in this clinical area."
2,Neoplasms,Malignant neoplasms of female genital organs,Image guided intensity modulated external beam radiochemotherapy and MRI based adaptive brachytherapy in locally advanced cervical cancer (EMBRACE-II),"The study originates in and is coordinated by a European centre.  The purpose of this application is to allow UK centres to participate.  Cervix cancer is a relatively rare cancer and research in the past has been largely limited to single institution case series.  Recently a European collaborative group endorsed by GEC-ESTRO has collected prospective data regarding current management strategy and outcomes to report the current standard of care and outcomes in Europe.  This is a single arm interventional study following from the previous work. It is for women with cervix cancers too advanced to be treated surgically.  Until recently standard treatment was (conformal) external beam radiotherapy given with concurrent chemotherapy followed by brachytherapy delivered with intrauterine applicators.  Studies have shown that this is an effective treatment in small and medium sized tumours but disease control in larger tumours is  suboptimal resulting in uncontrolled pelvic tumour in 25% of patients with very locally advanced tumours (stage3b).   Treatment using conventional conformal radiotherapy and traditional brachytherapy confers significant long term toxicity (up to 30% experience moderate to severe bowel and urinary toxicity), increased patient reported symptoms and reduction in quality of life.  Control of larger tumours and treatment toxicity can be improved by using newer techniques.  These include image guided brachytherapy  with the use of interstitial implants (IGIBT) , dose optimisation and the use of image guided intensity modulated radiotherapy (IGIMRT). This study aims to optimise these strategies across multiple centres by protocolised implementation of IGIMRT, using data from previous collaboration; to reduce volumes irradiated during IGIMRT by risk stratification; and to optimise IGBT dose prescriptions according to data from previous studies.  It will be open in a number of centres in mainland Europe and, subject to approval, at least 4-8 in the UK. It aims to recruit 1000 patients over 4 years.","Cancer of the uterine cervix considered suitable for curative treatment with definitive radio-(chemo)therapy including MRI guided BT  Positive biopsy showing squamous-cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or adeno-squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix.

14,Diseases of the genitourinary system,Noninflammatory disorders of female genital tract,Bariatric surgery vs. Medical care for obesity and polycystic ovarian syndrome related infertility: The BAMBINI randomised-controlled clinical trial,"Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) affects up to 1 in 5 women and is the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive potential. Weight-loss treatments have been shown to be effective in improving the number of periods a woman with PCOS can have and eventually get pregnant. Recent data suggest that bariatric surgery, like the vertical sleeve gastrectomy can be effective in achieving this. However, this has not been proven in a high quality randomised controlled clinical trial. This is what is needed to change national and international guidelines and enable PCOS to become an indication for bariatric surgery    The purpose of this study is to evaluate how effective and safe the sleeve gastrectomy is in the treatment of PCOS, i.e. can it make women start having periods.  We want to assess this effectiveness by comparing the procedure to lifestyle modification conducted in a centre of excellence.","â¢ Pre-menopausal women > = 18 years old  â¢ Body mass index (BMI) > =  35 kg/m2 with obesity related complications  â¢ Diagnosis of PCOS based on International evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome 2018 that requires two of the following:   i.  for women > 3 years post menarche to peri-menopause:  < 21 or > 35 days or < 8 cycles per year hyperandrogenism  a. clinical hirsutism (Modified Ferriman-Galwey hirsutism score > =  4-6) or male pattern alopecia (positive Ludwig visual score)] or  b. biochemical (raised free androgen index or free testosterone)  ii. polycystic ovaries on ultrasound: Using transvaginal ultrasound transducers with a frequency bandwidth that includes 8MHz, the threshold for PCOM should be on either ovary, a follicle number per ovary of > 20 and/or an ovarian volume > =  10ml, ensuring no corpora lutea, cysts or dominant follicles are present."
2,Neoplasms,"Malignant neoplasms of ill-defined, secondary and unspecified sites","DRAGON 1 - training, accreditation, implementation and safety evaluation of Portal and Hepatic Vein Embolization (PVE/HVE) to accelerate Future Liver Remnant (FLR) hypertrophy","Liver resections of liver metastasis from a primary colorectal cancer can only be performed if there is a sufficient future liver remnant (FLR). This is commonly estimated by calculation of the total liver volume and the FLR volume. When preoperatively the estimated FLR is insufficient (traditionally < 30% of the total volume)some strategies are performed in order to promote liver hypertrophy/regeneration (increase of the volume of the FLR). The gold standard technique is portal vein embolization (PVE) that is  the occlusion of the portal vein of one the sides of the liver that is planned to be resected (commonly the right or left sides of the liver). This allows an increased blood flow to the FLR and promotes its hypertrophy.   Based on the same principle, embolization of both portal vein and hepatic veins  (PVE/HVE) on one side of the liver may be superior to PVE alone to enhance liver regeneration, but is a novel procedure and requires a safety and feasibility evaluation.  The current study, DRAGON 1, is designed to assess the ability of each participating centre to recruit 3 patients for the study without 90-day mortality due to complications (i.e. not due to primary tumour disease) within 12 months.  Once this study endpoint is met by one of the participating centres, this centre is offered to participate in the comparative randomized DRAGON 2 trial that will compare PVE vs. PVE/HVE.","â¢ Patients with primarily unresectable/potentially resectable CRLM after conversion chemotherapy with a FLR < 30% in normal livers or 40% in livers chemotherapy damaged livers.

5,Mental and behavioural disorders,"Schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders","Exploring how young people who hear voices, and parents of young people who hear voices, make sense of voice-hearing in the family context","This qualitative study will explore how young people aged 12-19 who hear voices, and parents of such young people, have made sense of the experience in the family context.  Around 8% of children and young people are thought to regularly hear voices others donât, yet this remains remarkably under-researched. Making sense of voice-hearing is seen as therapeutically valuable and can aid recovery, while reducing distress, shame and stigma.  While voice-hearing itself is a individual experience, the sense made of it inevitably involves other people. For most young people, sense-making involves the family.  Yet family members may struggle to understand the voice-hearing experience and may be dealing with their own strong negative personal reactions. The study will recruit 2 groups with up to 10 in each group; one group will be young people aged 12-19 who hear voices and have received support from secondary or tertiary services for this. The other group will be parents of such young people. Participants will be involved in an interview lasting up to 60 minutes.  The interview will look at participantsâ views, perceptions and feelings about voice-hearing, and how these may have been explored and influenced by the family. Understanding the lived experience of young people and parents in relation to voice-hearing is a pressing concern for the NHS.  It is hoped that this study will give professionals a better sense of how to positively support young people and their families in making sense of voice-hearing.   It will inform the development of support and services for individuals, families and carers. The research should also contribute to understanding of how young people and their families make sense of unusual experiences more generally, so may be transferable to other young peopleâs and Early Intervention in Psychosis services.","Young people  â¢ Currently hear noises or voices that others donât, at least once per month  â¢ Aged 12-19    â¢ Received support from secondary / tertiary services for hearing voices  â¢ Able to talk about their experiences in an individual interview for around 60 minutes  â¢ Capacity to  consent / assent to the research, and have parental consent if under 16  â¢ Fluent in English     Parents   â¢ Parent of a young person whose voice hearing started between age 12-19 and has received support from secondary or tertiary services  â¢ Able to talk about their experiences in an individual interview for around 60 minutes  â¢ Capacity to consent to the research   â¢ Fluent in English"
9,Diseases of the circulatory system,"Diseases of arteries, arterioles and capillaries",CardiovASCulAr and bleeDing outcomEs associated with antithrombotic therapy (CASCADE) study,"Harmful blood clotting (thrombosis) plays a major role in many different cardiovascular diseases including heart attacks, deep vein thrombosis and stroke. It is well-established that anti-blood clotting medications are an effective treatment in a variety of clinical settings. However, these medications can cause spontaneous bleeding, which may be severe. It is now recognised that severe bleeding is actually as harmful as a recurrent thrombotic event. Therefore, new cardiovascular treatment strategies have been able to reduce the risk of death in patients by reducing the risk of severe bleeding whilst maintaining the same cardiovascular benefit as existing treatment strategies.    The aim of this study is to identify risk factors for bleeding and recurrent thrombosis in patients that are treated with anti-blood clotting medications. The study will identify which molecular and cellular mechanisms related to blood clotting are the most important in determining whether or not a patient will suffer a spontaneous bleed. It will also determine whether markers of function of the clotting system can be combined with other important parameters (such as clinical details, past medical history, concurrent medications) to predict subsequent spontaneous bleeding. In combination, these findings have the potential to drive the development of new anti-blood clotting treatment strategies that minimise the risk of bleeding. This has the potential to improve patient mortality and reduce the unwanted side effects of these treatments.    This will be an observational, longitudinal study of 1,184 patients treated with antithrombotic therapy and 44 age- and sex-matched controls that are not treated with antithrombotic therapy. We will record clinical details and we will perform a heart tracing and take samples of blood and urine for analysis. Patients will return after 2 years (and 1 month in some patients) so that we can assess whether they have suffered from bleeding or recurrent thrombotic events.",Provide signed and dated informed consent form  Over 18 years of age  Treatment group: Recent treatment with medications that have effects on platelets and/or coagulation (or initiation of such treatments is imminent)  Control group: Age- and sex-matched controls that are not treated with known antithrombotic drugs.
18,"Symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified",General symptoms and signs,Identifying candidate digital measures for the assessment of sleep and fatigue in the home environment,"Sleep disturbances and fatigue have a large impact on physical, mental and social well-being. These symptoms are highly prevalent in many diseases including Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Primary SjÃ¶grenâs Syndrome (PSS) and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Current assessments of sleep and fatigue and their impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and activities of daily living (ADL) rely on patient reported outcome measures (PROMs). However, PROMs are prone to recall bias, reliability issues and poor sensitivity to change.    The lack of effective assessment tools for sleep and fatigue is a key barrier to therapeutic development and clinical management of these symptoms. A novel approach is needed that is accurate and can be used in the natural environment of the patients. Mobile digital technologies (devices worn on or near the body) have the potential for measuring and monitoring sleep, fatigue and other functional outcomes relevant for daily living objectively and reliably.    The aim of this feasibility study is to identify candidate digital measurements (or combinations of measurements) that are related to fatigue, sleep disturbances and disabilities in specific ADL. Participants (healthy volunteers, patients with RA, SLE or PSS) will attend the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals Trust at the start of the study during which their disease (for patient participants) and their symptoms, HRQoL and ADLs will be assessed using standardised measurement tools. Participants have an option to donate blood, urine, and/or stool sample for biobanking for future research. Participants will then use different digital technologies (in various combinations in order to capture different digital measurements) over a 42-day period (including breaks), during which simple symptom diary will be collected. Participants will also attend an optional end of study visit to provide feedback on their experience of the study. The most promising digital parameters identified will be further evaluated in a subsequent study.","â¢  Age > 18 years, both genders.  â¢  Anticipated availability for using multiple study devices over the period of 42 days, with appropriate breaks within this period.  â¢  Willingness to comply with the study protocol including the use of the digital devices and technologies.  â¢  Previous use of a smartphone for at least 3 months.  â¢  Ability to understand oral and/or written instructions in relation to the study protocol and Informed Content in English or the native language of the country in residence with or without reasonable assistance.  â¢  Willingness to sign the IRB-approved Informed Consent Form (ICF) having had enough time and opportunity to think about his/her participation in the study.  â¢ Ability to walk independently, to sit and stand, socialise, communicate and capable of carrying out the various procedures proposed in the study, according to the opinion of the Investigator.   â¢ MoCA > 15.   â¢ In case of severe illness: availability of one caregiver / family member / friend that will be available to help for various study procedures.

2,Neoplasms,"Malignant neoplasms, stated or presumed to be primary, of lymphoid, haematopoietic and related tissue",VIRel: Viral immunotherapy in Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma - A Phase I Study to Assess the Safety and Tolerability of REOLYSINÂ® (pelareorep) in Combination with Lenalidomide or Pomalidomide,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a cancer of the bone marrow with an incidence of approximately 5500 new cases per year. Despite the availability of a range of treatments, most MM patients will relapse and eventually become resistant to current therapies. REOLYSINÂ® is a type of virus (reovirus) which attacks cancer cells, but not normal cells, and also activates the bodyâs immune system. Most people have contact with reovirus in the environment but it doesnât usually cause any symptoms or illness. Previous trials of REOLYSINÂ® in both solid and haematological cancers have shown that it is well-tolerated with manageable side effects and indicate that it may be an effective treatment. Lenalidomide and pomalidomide are immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) which act against MM cells in a range of ways, including affecting the immune system. Patients who develop relapsed MM while receiving IMiDs have a competent immune system and it is thought that the addition of REOLYSINÂ® at this point may stimulate immune-mediated disease control. The proposed study will recruit patients (up to 44 in total) currently receiving either lenalidomide or pomalidomide whose disease is relapsing. The aim of this trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of REOLYSINÂ® that can be given in combination with lenalidomide or pomalidomide. The trial will also investigate the safety, side effects and effectiveness of this treatment combination. Participants will be recruited from NHS Hospitals throughout the UK, which are approved research sites within the Myeloma UK Early Phase Clinical Network. Participants will be required to attend hospital regularly for tests and they will receive REOLYSINÂ® treatment, which is given by drip into a vein, once a week. Lenalidomide and pomalidomide are given orally. Participants will receive the trial treatment until their disease progresses further or if the treatment causes unacceptable side effects.","â¢ Diagnosed with symptomatic multiple myeloma (according to IMWG 2014 criteria)   â¢ Evaluable disease by modified IMWG criteria (i.e. by abnormal serum M protein, urinary M protein or serum free light chain assays)   â¢ Currently receiving either lenalidomide or pomalidomide therapy, alone or in combination with other myeloma therapy, with evidence of serological or clinical disease progression as defined by IMWG criteria (2011)   â¢ Life expectancy of â¥ 3 months   â¢ ECOG performance status of â¤2   â¢ Required laboratory values within 14 days prior to dose allocation: Absolute neutrophil count â¥ 1.0 x10^9 /L.

4,"Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases",Diabetes mellitus,A study to pilot and refine the DAFNEplus (Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating) programme for adults with type 1 diabetes,"DAFNE stands for Dose Adjustment For Normal Eating. It is a 5-day training course for adults with type 1 diabetes, delivered in small groups. DAFNE has been delivered to over 30,000 adults in the UK. Our recent research confirmed that after attending a DAFNE course, people have better quality of life, better glucose levels (in the short-term) and are admitted to hospital less often for diabetes emergencies. Although participants find DAFNE training useful, some find it tough to keep up the skills needed to maintain glucose levels to prevent diabetic complications. After the course, people also find it hard to get support from health professionals. They have asked us to improve the course to help others develop and keep their skills over the long term. This current study is part of a larger programme of research called DAFNEplus. The aim of DAFNEplus is to develop and convert DAFNE into a lifelong package to help people better manage their blood glucose levels in the longer term, as high levels can cause dangerous complications. We are doing this by revising the course, putting together structured follow-up with health professionals after the course, and using technology to help people maintain the skills they need to manage their type 1 diabetes effectively. The aim of this current study is to pilot and refine the prototype DAFNEplus programme (updated DAFNE course with structured follow up and support from technology) in three centres. The data that we collect in this study will be used to improve the design of DAFNEplus, and to inform the decision by the research funder whether it is feasible for the study team to evaluate DAFNEplus in a large scale trial in 14 centres starting in 2018.","The inclusion criteria for patient participants are: Adults (> 17 years) with type 1 diabetes for at least 6 months, or post-honeymoon*; prepared to undertake multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy and frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose; able to attend the full course one day a week over 5 weeks and participate in the follow-up. These are the standard criteria for referral to the DAFNE programme. * The honeymoon period refers to the time when, post-diagnosis, people start taking insulin injections, and their insulin producing cells sometimes recover for a while. The dose of insulin needed might reduce during this period, and some people might even need to stop using insulin for a while, but eventually it will be needed again. The criteria for referral to DAFNE at least 6 months after diagnosis is to allow for the honeymoon period to have passed before attendance at the course"
10,Diseases of the respiratory system,Influenza and pneumonia,Safety of Nasal Influenza Immunisation in Children with Asthma: The SNIFFLE 4 study,"Since 2013, the UK government has begun to phase in the introduction of Fluenz, an influenza (âflu) vaccine given as a nasal spray, to all children aged 2-18 years. Fluenz has been available in the United States since 2003, and has been given to over a million children. Previous studies have shown the vaccine to be highly effective and against influenza infection, with an excellent safety profile.     Like most 'flu vaccines, Fluenz is grown in henâs eggs and contains egg protein, and until recently there were no data on its use in egg-allergic children. For this reason, we conducted the SNIFFLE-1 and -2 studies, which demonstrated the safety of the vaccine in children with egg allergy. The studies also provided reassuring data that Fluenz can be given the children with asthma/recurrent wheezing without causing acute respiratory symptoms. This is important, due to some data which demonstrated infants under 12 months of age might be at increased risk of wheezing post vaccination with Fluenz. However, only a limited number of children with ""severe"" asthma - requiring high dose inhaled corticosteroid therapy or more (BTS 4+ treatment) were included in this cohort, which limited the conclusions which could be drawn regarding this group of children.    We now wish to assess the safety of Fluenz in children attending two specialist asthma clinics to obtain data which can be used to inform national UK guidance on Fluenz administration. The study will run during the winter âflu vaccination season (autumn 2016 to early 2017).","1. Aged 2 â 18 years old     2.

5,Mental and behavioural disorders,Behavioural syndromes associated with physiological disturbances and physical factors,FREED-UP: First Episode and Rapid Early Intervention Service for Young People with Eating Disorders â Upscaled,"We have developed a novel First Episode and Rapid Early Intervention Service for ED (FREED) for young people (aged 16-25) with short ( < 3 years) first episode illness duration, which overcomes barriers to effective early treatment and recovery.    A pilot study demonstrated that FREED reduces waiting time for treatment by 52-68% compared to audit data from matched patients previously seen in our service and the overall duration of untreated ED (DUED) by up to 25% compared to audit or by ~ 50% compared to previously published data. 100% of FREED patients took up treatment, compared with 87% from published data and treatment dropout was 15% compared to 20-44% from published data. Satisfaction with FREED was very high, and clinical improvement is rapid with patients on average no longer fulfilling criteria for a clinical ED at 6 months.     Aims:   To implement and disseminate FREED across different services and create evidence for the scalability of this approach, so FREED can become a national model of service delivery.     Objectives:    To achieve the following specific quality improvements in participating services: (1) reduce wait-time and DUED in young people, (2) improve treatment engagement (3) improve clinical outcomes and (4) demonstrate cost-effectiveness.      Setting:   Three specialist ED services in Greater London and one in Yorkshire.  Funded by the Health Foundation.        Approach:   To assess successful implementation of FREED, we will use a mixed methods approach. For waiting-times and DUED, we will carry out a case-control comparison of FREED participants with patients (matched for age and illness duration) treated in participating units prior to starting FREED. Additionally, we will carry out a 1-year outcome evaluation of a proportion of participants and their carers. Qualitative interviews (patients, carers, clinicians, commissioners) will also be conducted.     Key measures:   Wait-time, DUED, treatment uptake, drop-out, ED outcomes at baseline, 3-, 6- and 12-months.","All young people, aged 16 to 25, within three years of onset of eating disorder.

9,Diseases of the circulatory system,Cerebrovascular diseases,What is the impact of large scale implementation of stroke Early Supported Discharge?,"Early supported discharge (ESD) services provide early, home based rehabilitation for stroke survivors. Research suggests that people who receive ESD spend less time in the hospital and have better recovery than patients who did not. Following recommendations in UK national policy documents and clinical guidelines a variety of ESD services have now been set up across England. However, the type of ESD service patients receive on the ground is variable and in some regions ESD is still not offered at all.     This multi-site study is part of a bigger project aiming to assess the impact of implementing ESD in real world conditions and investigate which models of ESD are effective in practice.Under a realist evaluation framework a case study design will be used to investigate three purposively selected ESD teams from East Midlands, East of England and North of England respectively.     We will interview NHS staff members to gain a better understanding of how ESD services operate in practice, identify factors contributing to the adoption and implementation of ESD models as well as contextual influences to their effectiveness and sustainability. Stroke survivors will also be asked about their experiences of ESD services and what matters to them the most.    Findings may facilitate improvements in stroke services across England towards the provision of efficient, evidence based care and better patient recovery.","1. Staff participants:    â¢ Adults (over the age of 18 years)  â¢ NHS staff participants involved in delivery of the ESD service (i.e. consultants, occupational therapists, rehabilitation assistants, physiotherapists, social workers, nursing staff, psychologists and administrators)  â¢ Stroke service commissioners (i.e. members of a Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) involved in the commissioning of ESD services)      2. Patient participants:    All stroke patients who are admitted to ESD services and fit the eligibility criteria used by the hospital and community-based staff. Eligibility criteria are likely to include the patient wishing to return home, that they are medically stable and that they can transfer independently or with the assistance of one person. It is highly unlikely that stroke patients with mental capacity issues and those unable to consent, will be eligible or referred to an ESD service.      â¢ Having sustained first or recurrent stroke,  â¢ Medically stable,  â¢ Ability to give informed consent,   â¢ Aged between 16 and 100 years old.   â¢ In the servicesâ caseload at the time of recruitment"
11,Diseases of the digestive system,Diseases of liver,BioPasSPoRT- Biomarkers for patient assessment and stratification post-renal transplant - technical study,"Chronic  kidney  disease (CKD)  affects  about  8-16%  of  the  adult  population  and  is   increasing dramatically,  linked  to global epidemics  in  diabetes,  hypertension and obesity (1-3).   It is estimated that 2-4% of people with CKD  will  eventually develop end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) requiring dialysis or transplantation with 2.6 million people having such treatment (4).  Kidney transplantation offers significantly better survival, quality of life and cost savings compared to dialysis (5). For example, in the UK with -3,200 kidney transplants annually, transplants save the NHS -Â£85 million in dialysis costs/year.  Almost 80,000 kidney transplants  are  performed annually worldwide  with  >10-fold  that on waiting lists (www.transplant-observatory.org). Consequently, kidneys donated after circulatory death  &  extended  criteria  donor  kidneys  are  increasingly  used but  have  higher  incidences  of complications such as delayed graft function {DGF) where the kidney fails to function well in the first week post-transplant, necessitating dialysis (6,7}. Affecting 20-40% of patients, DGF is associated with a higher risk of mortality, transplant loss, need for dialysis, kidney biopsy and increased hospital stay (7-9). There is an urgent need for better biomarkers to predict or diagnose DGF earlier and stratify patients in terms of long-term outcome, enabling better clinical management strategies with major implications for patient benefit and resource savings.    In   Leeds  we   identified  a    novel  biomarker  aminoacylase-1   (ACY-1)  measured  in  blood   that complements cystatin C  in providing earlier prediction of DGF  but also importantly provides very strong prognostic information regarding long-term outcome in patients with DGF (10). This biomarker was patented  and  a  partnership developed  with  Randox  Laboratories to  explore the  biomarker further.  Through an SBRI award followed by an Innovate UK-funded Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund award, the Leeds research assay has been successfully transferred to the Randox Investigator analysis platform and the initial results generated in Leeds confirmed.  Additional biomarkers are also being explored on multiplex biochips and the results generated using our existing banks of clinical samples will  be used to  identify the  optimum  combination  (the  ""Renal Transplant  Panel"") which  will  be developed for diagnosis/prognosis of DGF commercially.    An important part of this overall programme of work  is a  prospective technical  study in patients following renal transplantation as described here, to determine the detailed kinetic behaviour and stability of the  biomarkers and any specific pre-analytical considerations which can impact on the results, for example serum versus plasma, delays in processing time, length of frozen storage time. An additional element is a prospective pilot study focussing on patients following liver transplantation to determine if it is likely that any of the selected biomarkers may also be useful in the this patient group which may then stimulate further larger-scale studies in the future",Adults aged 18 years and older.

6,Diseases of the nervous system,Other degenerative diseases of the nervous system,"A novel, free to use, measure of combined cognitive and functional abilities for clinical use.","Background:   As many cognitive tests used in the NHS at present are subject to copyright, producing a validated copyright free cognitive testing tool is important to prevent unnecessary expenditure from the health service budget.  This study sets out to validate the Free Combined cognitive and functional assessment (FREE-COG) as an alternative. This tests aims to reflect a more holistic assessment to indicate areas of further testing to the clinician.  Aims:  To test the FREE-COG in naturalistic clinical settings to compare scores with existing, commonly used cognitive tests.  We hypothesise that there will be no significant difference between the FREE-COG and these tests.   Methods: 500 patients with known or suspected mild cognitive impairment/ dementia would be recruited by clinicians/researchers.  They would complete the FREE-COG in a situation where clinically cognitive testing would be used and subsequently complete clinical cognitive test in current standard NHS practice.  We will also aim to recruit 250 healthy controls who may be carers or both participant groups can be identified utilising the Join Dementia Research Service.    Future : Non-English language, culturally appropriate versions of the FREE-COG are proposed and further more extensive studies in other patient populations, including comparisons between different dementia populations (eg comparing outcomes Alzheimerâs dementia vs vascular dementia, Mild Cognitive Impairment and healthy volunteers).",People with suspected cognitive impairment/dementia:  Over the age of 18 years old.

4,"Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases",Diabetes mellitus,PROSPECTIVE STUDY OF THE IMPACT AND COST OF CHARCOT INFLAMMATORY OSTEOARTHROPATHY OF THE FOOT IN DIABETES IN THE EAST MIDLANDS,"The Charcot foot is an uncommon complication of nerve damage (neuropathy) in people with diabetes. It is characterised by inflammation of the foot with varying degrees of damage to the bones and joints, including fractures and dislocations that can lead to a very deformed foot. The consequences to patients include a high risk of  limb loss, and it is also associated with poor life expectancy.   Although the condition is well described clinically, no previous attempt has been made to assess its incidence in a well defined population. Similarly, although the enormous cost of diabetic foot ulcers is well documented and is estimated to be approximately Â£1 billion per annum (and thus represents approximately 0.8% total NHS budget), there has been no previous attempt made to assess the cost of the Charcot foot in diabetes.","Of those involved in the incidence audit, those who give informed consent over a 6 month period will be included in the impact and cost study"
6,Diseases of the nervous system,Cerebral palsy and other paralytic syndromes,Mini-EDACS: Eating and Drinking Ability Classification System for young children with cerebral palsy.,"Background:    Damage to the developing infant brain (cerebral palsy) can affect movements required to suck, bite, chew and swallow food and drink safely and efficiently. There is no agreement about how to measure eating and drinking abilities of children with cerebral palsy (CP) younger than 3 years. This limits the study of early development of eating and drinking skills and connections with probable outcomes in later life.     We developed the Eating and Drinking Ability Classification System (EDACS) for children with CP from the age of 3 years. EDACS has been accepted by the international research community and is increasingly used in clinical practice including NHS. The existing content of EDACS is not suitable to describe the abilities of younger children who are still developing eating and drinking skills.     Aim:    We aim to develop and validate a new version of Eating and Drinking Ability Classification System (Mini-EDACS) suitable for use with children with CP aged 18 to 36 months.    Method:     1. Define content of Mini-EDACS:  We will define the content of Mini-EDACS by examining existing data of 130 young children with CP (18-60 months) and applying EDACS. Content of EDACS will be modified to create Mini-EDACS to capture and distinguish between eating and drinking abilities of children with CP aged 18 to 36 months.     2. Refine and validate content of Mini-EDACS:  We will invite parents, professional and research experts to examine and refine the proposed content of Mini-EDACS using an international Delphi Survey until 70% agreement.     3. Test reliability of Mini-EDACS:  Speech and language therapists (SLTs) and parents will use Mini-EDACS independently to assign a level describing eating and drinking abilities of children with CP aged between 18 and 36 months. The reliability of Mini-EDACS will be assessed by comparing pairs of judgments made by pairs of SLTs or parents vs SLTs.",Participants in the Delphi Survey will have the following characteristics:  â¢ Parents of children with cerebral palsy aged 5 years or younger  â¢ Health and care professionals with at least 2 yearsâ experience working with young children with CP with limitations to eating and drinking       Children eligible for inclusion in the inter-observer reliability studies will have the following characteristics:  â¢ Aged between 18 and 36 months  â¢ Diagnosis of Cerebral Palsy
5,Mental and behavioural disorders,Behavioural syndromes associated with physiological disturbances and physical factors,Brain imaging Of Emotion And Cognition Of adolescents with anorexia Nervosa (The BEACON study).,"Difficulties in cognitive and emotion processing has been observed in adults with AN and, albeit in an attenuated form, both adolescents with AN and unaffected relatives. It is thought to be a possible underlying mechanism in AN, likely to contribute to both disorder vulnerability and maintenance. Elucidating the neural correlates of this processing could help to give a better understanding of possible underlying factors and develop more targeted treatments.    AIMS:  This study aims to investigate the brain correlates of cognitive and emotion processing in children and adolescents with Anorexia Nervosa (AN), and investigate whether differential patterns of brain function can be matched to illness severity.    SETTING:  Participants with AN will be recruited for the Child and Adolescent Eating Disorder Service, South London & Maudsley NHS Trust. Healthy control participants will be recruited from advertisements in local community areas (e.g. libraries).    APPROACH:  We will use function Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to examine both structural and functional differences between adolescents with AN and healthy control adolescents (all aged between 12-18 years). Participants will be asked to complete neuropsychological tasks in and out of the fMRI scanner as well as completing self-report questionnaires. To assess whether different profiles of processing and structural and function changes are related to the stage of illness, we will also use data previously collected in our lab from adults with AN that used a similar methodology.","For the AN group, females aged between 12 - 18 years, with diagnosis of AN will be recruited. Percentage weight for height must be below 90%.    For the HC group, females aged between 12- 18 years, with no past or present psychiatric morbidity. Furthermore, they must have a percentage Weight for Height (W4H) of between 91-120%.     As the data from the same children and adolescents will be used for the analysis in the second part of the study, the same inclusion criteria will apply."
20,Mental and behavioural disorders,Mood [affective] disorders,Adapting and testing a technology supported and solution-focused intervention (DIALOG+) for people with chronic depression,"This research aims to develop a new approach to help people with depression. Depression is a common mental health problem affecting one in four people at some point in their life. It can result in high levels of distress, increased suicide risk and a loss of interest in daily activities. Most people with depression find treatment helpful. However for some people (about one in five), depression continues for more than two years, despite receiving mental health treatment. This is called âchronic depressionâ. Approaches for chronic depression are limited, and people often continue to have a poor quality of life.  In previous research we developed an intervention called âDIALOG+â which helped patients with another serious mental illness called schizophrenia. DIALOG+ involved mental health staff using a tablet computer to ask patients about their satisfaction with different areas of life and then working together to find solutions to concerns raised. After using DIALOG+, patients were more satisfied with life and had fewer symptoms. Patients and staff found the approach helpful and it saved the NHS money.   The first phase of the TACK programme seeks to investigate whether DIALOG+ can also help people with chronic depression. We will see if DIALOG+ is acceptable by asking people with depression their opinions on the approach so we can adapt it to their needs. We will also be asking clinicians about their experience and views for adapting the intervention. Following this, we will conduct a study with nine staff members and 45 patients with depression to gain further experience with DIALOG+ and check whether a larger study testing it would be possible.","Patient participants:  WP2 (qualitative study):  - Clinical diagnosis of depression with a duration of illness of at least 2 years.  - Using NHS mental health services for the treatment of depression  - Capacity to provide informed consent  - Ability to speak and understand English    WP3 (Feasibility study):  - Clinical diagnosis of depression with a duration of illness of at least 2 years.  - Using NHS mental health services for the treatment of depression with regular contact with clinicians  - Capacity to provide informed consent  - Ability to speak and understand English  - Current symptoms of depression (as indicated by a MADRS score > = 10)  - Current low quality of life(as indicated by a mean MANSA score < 5)    Clinician participants:  WP2 (Qualitative study):  - Qualification as a mental health or healthcare professional,   - Experience of working in health care for at least six months;   - Currently (or within the last six months) treating individuals with chronic depression   - No plans to leave their post within the next three months (exploratory testing only).

5,Mental and behavioural disorders,Disorders of adult personality and behaviour,What is the Risk of Under Diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in Adults with Personality Disorder (PD) in a UK Mental Health Trust?,"When people suffer from mental health problems, it is not always easy to tell what the cause is. Two conditions that can cause people to suffer from similar problems are called Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Personality Disorder (PD). These two conditions can also sometimes happen at the same time in a person. Research that has already been done says that up to 37% of people with PD also have ADHD. Our records in Leicestershire currently say that only 2% of people have these two conditions together. This study wants to find out how many people with PD possibly also have ADHD that a doctor hasnât diagnosed yet.     The way this study will try and find this out will be to ask all the patients with a diagnosis of PD to fill out two questionnaires. One questionnaire is to say whether a diagnosis of PD is likely. The other questionnaire is to say whether a diagnosis of ADHD is likely. All the patients who show that they are likely to have a diagnosis of ADHD will then have their doctor told. The doctor will then be asked to check this and treat it if needed.  This study is important because ADHD and PD are treated very differently. PD is mostly treated with talking therapy. ADHD is mostly treated with medication. If the ADHD is not treated, it is less likely that the talking therapy will help with the problems they have because of their PD. This study could also save the NHS money as patients will get better quickly and then cost less money.","â¢ Adult service users (aged 18+ years) seen as patients in the trust   â¢ Must have a recorded ICD-10 diagnosis of personality disorder (F60-F61) on our computerised records system (Rio)   â¢ Adults with co-morbid diagnoses such as substance misuse, depression and anxiety will not be excluded to reflect the real-life clinical setting  â¢ Their consenting is also part of the inclusion criteria"
19,"Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes",Injuries to the hip and thigh,AceFIT â Acetabular Fractures in older patients Intervention Trial. A feasibility study comparing three methods of treatment of acetabular fractures in older patients; surgical fixation versus surgical fixation and hip replacement versus non-surgical treatment.,"Approximately 1,500 older people break the pelvic part of their hip joint (acetabulum) each year in the UK. These fractures are challenging in older patients as the bone is often fragile and in many pieces. There are 2 main accepted treatment options; non-operative and operative. The operative option can include surgical fixation, or surgical fixation combined with hip replacement. Patients treated non-operatively or with surgical fixation must keep off their injured leg until their fracture has healed. Consequently these patients often have a prolonged recovery time and may have a poorly functioning hip joint after the fracture has healed. Treatment with surgery to replace the hip joint at the same time the fracture is being fixed avoids the problem of a damaged hip joint and most positively enables patients to start walking on their injured leg immediately. Currently we do not know which of these treatments is best. We are proposing to undertake a randomised study comparing three treatments; non-surgical treatment, surgical fixation and surgical fixation combined with hip replacement in older patients. Patients who are eligible and have agreed to participate will be randomly allocated to one of the three treatment groups; 20 patients will not receive any surgery and will be encouraged to weight bear as tolerated, 20 patients will receive surgical fixation and 20 surgical fixation combined with hip replacement. We will collect information from patients (and their carers) about their health before they receive their allocated treatment and collect more information (including complications, health related questionnaires, length of stay and x-ray pictures) at 6 weeks, 6 months and 9 months after their surgery. This will allow us to assess the feasibility of comparing the treatments at the end of a subsequent more definitive study.","â¢ Male or female aged 60 years or over, including those with cognitive impairment, who have sustained a displaced acetabular fracture where the treating surgeon considers it to be sufficiently displaced to consider surgery (fractures involving displacement of either anterior column, posterior column or quadrilateral plate, posterior wall with marginal impaction). â¢ Informed consent to participate from the patient, or agreement from a personal or nominated consultee (in the case of patients who are lacking capacity to consent)."
