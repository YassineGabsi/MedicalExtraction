Saline Nasal Irrigation For acute Sinusitis II RCT,"Acute sinus infections are one of the commonest infections managed in primary care, Currently GPs prescribe antibiotics to most  patients presenting with sinusitis, the highest of any of the common acute infections presenting in adults, at over 90%.The trouble with prescribing for most people is that we are using antibiotics too much which is causing the bacteria to become resistant, which is likely to lead in the future to  serious infections  becoming untreatable from âsuperbugsâ. Alternatives to the initial management with antibiotics are needed.  Previous studies have tried nasal irrigation using salt solution for colds but the studies are small and not conclusive. There have also been studies of nasal irrigation in chronic sinus  infections which do show some benefit. A large study in chronic or recurrent sinusitis in primary care showed that most people can learn to do nasal irrigation with simple advice and a short video to show how it is done, find it acceptable and will keep doing it over several weeks. However, there was some evidence that the approach to help people use nasal irrigation could be made more effective, dealing with key barriers or difficulties more effectively. There have been no good studies of saline irrigation in acute sinusitis.  The first part of the proposed study over a few months and will optimise the intervention, by working with patients on a 1:1 basis. This will make sure we are providing all the necessary advice and materials to help engage patients and to deal with any issues or problems they might have.  The study will then randomise more than 100 people with acute sinus infections presenting in primary care to either a) immediate antibiotics (current usual treatment in primary care) or b) advice to do nasal irrigation for up to 3 weeks with a âback-upâ or delayed antibiotic prescription (a prescription that can be used if the sinusitis does not settle). Participants will fill out a daily symptom diary which will allow us to see whether irrigation makes any difference to symptom severity, or to the duration of illness,and whether antibiotic were used.   Participants who are happy to have further tests will have a swab of the nose.   This study will provide evidence of recruitment and follow-up rates, and is also likely to provide  preliminary evidence about whether antibiotic use is likely to be reduced, in order to provide sufficient evidence for a larger application for a full trial.","We will pragmatically define acute sinusitis as having sinus discomfort, and at least 2 other symptoms (2 of: patient reported nasal obstruction, patient reported purulent nasal discharge, or pus seen in the nasal cavity on inspection by the clinician). We do not propose using prior duration (e.g. the requirement for at least 7 days without improvement in the Canadian guidelines) since there is no good evidence for a particular cut-off, and our aim is to help people who are currently being treatment with antibiotics for sinusitis, many of whom present with 7 days."
"A double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, feasibility trial evaluating the possibility of delivering Andrographis paniculata  (Immunographis) as a treatment of adults with Acute Respiratory Tract Infections (ARTIs)","Acute respiratory infections (such as cough, sore throat and sinusitis) are common and therefore distressing and costly both for individuals and the NHS. Antibiotics have limited benefits and have side effects.    A herbal medicine called Andrographis Paniculata is a promising candidate to treat acute respiratory tract infections.  In a systematic review of randomised controlled trials Andrographis performed better than placebo after 5 days  We propose to evaluate the feasibility of using Andrographis capsules in adults who visit their GP with an acute respiratory tract infection symptom and where the GP thinks the symptoms are caused by an infection  (bacterial or viral) but NOT pneumonia. The doctor will be able to prescribe antibiotics if needed either taken immediately or delayed for a few days.","Patients will eligible for the trial if they are over 18 years of age and present to their GP with a potential ARTI. Adults 18 years and over presenting with an acute cough (< = 28 days' duration) as their main symptom and with symptoms localising to the upper respiratory tract (e.g. sore throat,headache,runny nose, muscle ache), for which non-infective diagnoses are judged very unlikely."
Regulation of Immunoglobulin class switching,"We wish to investigate how B cells regulate the process of immunoglobulin class switching in order to produce the appropriate type of antibody required to neutralise the particular infection they face.    All the experiments planned in this study will be carried out on B cells isolated from the tonsils and adenoids of patients (adults and children) undergoing routine tonsillectomies and adenoidectomies at Guyâs and St. Thomas NHS Foundation trust. Patients (and/or their legal guardians) will be approached by a member of the research team following admittance to the ward for surgery. Patients (and their legal guardians) will be given a copy of an information sheet to read, describing the purpose of our research and what will happen to them should they take part in the study, and asked to give their consent to be included. The researcher will be available at this time to answer any questions that may arise.    If consent is given the patients will be asked to fill out a short questionnaire (no more than 5 minutes). The answers to these questions will allow us to determine whether the participant falls into our ânormalâ or asthmatic/allergic group, ensure that they donât suffer from any other immune system diseases, they havenât got any long standing illness and they donât take any medicine that may affect the way in which their B cells respond in our experiments. This will end the participantâs involvement in this project: They will not be approached for any further questions or asked to give any other samples. Inclusion in this project will not affect the way in which the tonsillectomy surgery is performed or their treatment afterwards.     Following normal removal of the tonsils (and adenoids, if collected), our researchers will collect the discarded tissue and isolate the B cells from it for use in subsequent experiments. B cells will be isolated by density gradient centrifugation, following maceration of the tonsil. B cells will then be isolated by FACS sorting. The B cells will be treated with either IL-4, IFN-ï§ or TGF-ï¢ in conjunction with reagents to mimic CD40 signalling to stimulate them to undergo class switching to the different antibody isotypes. At various time points cells will be collected and analysed as described below. No tissue or cells will be stored following this procedure, however, DNA or proteins from the cells may be stored for use in subsequent experiments. All retained DNA/proteins will be stored in freezers (monitored with alarms) located in the Dept. of Respiratory medicine and Allergy. All stored material will be anonymised according to best current practices.",â¢ Age 1-65 years undergoing routine tonsillectomy surgery for chronic tonsillitis or Sleep Apnoea.   â¢ Written informed consent obtained before entering the study  â¢ Absence of acute infection at time or surgery
The SIMPLIFI (Single use Isothermal aMPLIfication testing for Flu Illnesses) Study.  Evaluation of a single use point of care device for the diagnosis of influenza and other respiratory pathogens in clinical upper airway samples using isothermal amplification - a feasibility study.,"This is a prospective single centre feasibility study in the accident and emergency (A+E) department of Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust (ICHNT) in patients presenting with influenza like illness (ILI).    The primary objective is to assess the feasibility of this single use device for the diagnosis of influenza and other respiratory pathogens in upper airway samples at the point of care (POC) in a real-life setting and compare the results against the conventional laboratory diagnostic methods of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing.  Further objectives are to compare the results to the analytical study data and laboratory test on stored samples as well as develop a bank of samples for further testing of the device in laboratory conditions.     One nasal swab to be taken per patient recruited in addition to the swab(s) (nasal, nasopharyngeal or throat swab) taken for standard care.  Routine sample(s) (A) to be processed for standard PCR testing in the laboratory and/or rapid flu testing (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) as per standard clinical work flow.  Second sample (B) to be taken for evaluation under the study and either: (i) transferred to the new device buffer tube and promptly tested in a test device or (ii) if no device is available for prompt testing, add the swab to a viral storage/transport buffer tube as per standard procedures and freeze for long-term storage and later testing.      As this is a feasibility study, diagnostic standard of care tests should be performed as per the clinical pathway with routine sample(s) (A) and the results of the test devices should not affect clinical decisions and should not be disclosed to either the patient or the clinician.","Any adult > = 18 years of age presenting to the A+E department with ILI or a febrile illness associated with symptoms such as cough, sore throat or rhinorrhoea, and for whom a respiratory viral screen is clinically indicated and who is:  - Able to provide written informed consent, or written informed assent by a relative or carer   - Recruited during initial medical assessment  - Able to comply with the study protocol"
Coronavirus infection in primary or secondary immunosuppressed children,"This study is designed to allow families of immunosuppressed children and young people to self-record their experiences of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses during the COVID-19 epidemic. Parents of immunosuppressed patients and young people aged 16-17 yrs who are immunosuppressed will be provided with online information and asked to fill in online questionnaires at baseline and weekly thereafter. Information collected will include immune-system affecting medication, symptoms, contact with health care providers, test results and impact on daily activities. Data will be collected and analysed weekly to be able to monitor any potential risk factors for severe disease.  This study is complementary to, and not overlapping with, the global ISARIC World Health Organisation protocol that will be studying COVID-19 cases admitted to all NHS Trusts, including all children.",- Parent of immunosuppressed patient aged < 16 years or immunosuppressed patient aged 16-17 years   - Family able to complete the questionnaire which will be in English (due to current resources available translation will not be possible)  - Reliable access to the internet
Platform randomised controlled trial of point of care diagnostics for enhancing the quality of antibiotic prescribing for community acquired acute respiratory tract infection in ambulatory care in Europe,"The discovery of antibiotics was a major breakthrough in medical science. Antibiotics are used to treat illness caused by bacteria. Development of these medicines meant that illnesses, like pneumonia, which were once often fatal, could be successfully treated, saving millions of lives. But their effectiveness has decreased because they are misused. Highly resistant âsuperbugsâ have appeared against which we have no effective treatment. The development of antibiotic resistance is now a major public health concern worldwide.   Bacteria that are exposed to insufficient antibiotic can change and become resistant to their killing effects. Another cause of resistance is when antibiotics are prescribed when there is no evidence to prove which micro-organism is causing a patientâs symptoms. Clinical studies have shown that confirming a patient is more likely to be infected with a bacterium (or not) before prescribing an antibiotic by using a point-of-care test in a doctorâs surgery could help improve the quality of patient care and aid recovery. This is especially true for community-acquired acute respiratory tract infections (CA-ARTI), the commonest reasons for consulting health services in the community and for antibiotic use.  The aim of PRUDENCE is to determine if there is added value provided by having a CA-ARTI diagnostic (CA-ARTI-Dx) test done in the surgery to give a quick result. Then the result is available when a clinician is considering, or plans to prescribe an antibiotic, which could lead to more appropriate prescribing decisions, without causing harm to patients.    The study will be a pragmatic, platform, randomised controlled trial of point-of-care diagnostics, evaluated over two seasons of increased community acquired acute respiratory tract infections, in up to 10 European countries starting in January 2021.","â¢ Male or Female, aged 1 year or above  â¢ Consulting with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection where cough is the predominant symptom (< 28 days); or, symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection (< 14 days) where sore throat is the dominant symptom; and where the clinician is considering/has decided to prescribe an antibiotic  â¢ Is able and willing to comply with all trial requirements  â¢ Participant or legal guardian(s) of a child is willing and able to give informed consent according to national regulations"
Understanding general practitionersâ views and experiences of using clinical prediction rules in the management of respiratory infections: a qualitative study,"Inappropriate use of antibiotics continues to contribute to bacteria becoming resistant to treatment. A number of guidance sheets have been developed to help doctors decide when it is appropriate to prescribe antibiotics for respiratory tract infections such as sore throat, but it is not clear if they use these in their decision-making process. Limited evidence suggests doctors may not be familiar with these guidance sheets or prefer to use their own clinical judgement. Our study aims to explore UK doctorsâ views and experiences of using these (electronic) guidance sheets for respiratory tract infections. We will interview about 25-30 doctors from a range of urban, rural, large and small practices and with a mix of gender, age and years of experience, over the phone. We will ask them questions about barriers and facilitators of using these sheets during consultations. We will also explore whether uptake varies with years of clinical experience and across practices. The findings of the study will improve our understanding of reasons for using or not using guidance sheets and will allow more acceptable guidance sheets to be developed in the future to encourage more widespread adoption by doctors in practice. This in turn will reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing and resistant bacteria.",Qualified GPs currently working in hours in a general practice surgery and working with patients with RTIs.
PREparing for Improving the use of NHS primary care services and Antibiotics for children with respiratory Tract infections,"Respiratory tract infections (RTI) are common childhood illnesses. RTIs are the most common reason for child visits to primary care and also the most common reason for children to be given antibiotics. Most RTIs will get better without treatment, but a small minority develop into a more severe illness. Too many antibiotics are prescribed for childrenâs RTIs, contributing to the rise of antibiotic resistant bacteria. We propose to conduct interviews with clinicians to identify the optimal characteristics of an online tool for both parents and clinicians. During interview with primary care clinicians (GP and practice nurses) we will discuss the potential for incorporating a web-tool into their systems for a) supporting evidence-based antibiotic prescribing by clinicians and b) providing better information to parents about managing RTI in children, including supporting parents to decide when to seek an appointment or treatment. The Pre-INACT study will (overall) involve three research activities. The first a systematic review, followed by focus group sessions with parents. We are not seeking NHS ethics/HRA approval for the focus group sessions as this will be done in community settings with pre-existing parent groups. We are however seeking ethical consideration for this component of the Pre-INACT study from the University of Bristol's faculty of Medicine and Dentistry. We therefore wish to apply for HRA approval for up to 30 qualitative interviews with primary care staff (GPs/Practice Nurses and other associated healthcare professionals). These interviews will be conducted on NHS premises with the support of the local Clinical Research Networks (CRN).",Recruitment of clinician participants We will aim to recruit clinicians (GPs/practice nurses/and other associated staff) from practices serving different populations to reflect a mix of social/economic and ethic groups.
Reducing recurrent respiratory infections in primary care: The Immune Defence Study,"A range of viruses circulate each winter and cause respiratory infections (RTIs) (the viruses that causes colds, sore throats, sinus, chest or ear infections, flu). These can lead to people being off work, to seeking help from the NHS, and to be admitted to hospital in winter months. The combined effect of both the normal winter viruses (and also the COVID virus in the current pandemic) are likely to cause major problem for the NHS not only during the coming 2020-21 winter season but in subsequent years. There is promising evidence that using nasal sprays, or alternatively reducing stress and increasing exercise, could help peopleâs immune defences, reduce the number of people getting infections, reduce how severe illnesses are and how long they last. The NIHR has funded the RECUR Programme to develop and trial interventions to find out if they reduce the incidence of infections. We have developed a website called Immune Defence which will help us to see if using nasal sprays or getting more physically active and reducing stress can help people get fewer and less severe infections. We have involved both a range of patients and also patient representatives as collaborators in the design of our study to help ensure the procedures are relevant and appropriate to patients. We had planned a large feasibility study this year in the 2020-21 winter season, and a full trial in a ânormalâ year in the 2021-2023 winter seasons. However, the stage of development this year and our previous experience of running large similar trials suggests that instead of the feasibility study we can move to a larger full trial straight away among at risk groups so that we generate a sizeable sample during the pandemic. This study will involve approximately 200 GP practices and up to 15000 patients who are at risk from respiratory infections. Patients will be invited to take part in the study through invitation letters from their GP surgery. Those who are interested in taking part will be asked to register online and to answer some questions to ensure the study is right for them. Eligible patients will be randomised to one of the following groups for 12 months: i) A microgel nasal spray ii) Saline nasal spray, iii) Getting Active and Reducing Stress or iv) Usual Care. Participants will be asked to complete monthly questionnaires for 6 months, and more detailed questionnaires at 3, 6 and 12 months about any infections and about their general health. Patients happy to do so will complete a daily diary of symptoms if they do become unwell to give a more detailed understanding of the course of each illness. A sample of patients and healthcare practitioners will be asked to take part in a telephone interview about their experiences of taking part in the trial.",1) Patients aged > = 18 years with a risk factor: - Known weakened immune system due to a serious illness or medication (e.g. chemotherapy); - Known heart disease; - Known asthma or lung disease; - Known diabetes not treated with insulin; - Known mild hepatic impairment; - Known stroke or neurological problem;g) - Obesity (BMI> 30) - Patients with > = 3 episodes of an RTI in the last year 2) Patients aged > = 65years 3) Have access to the internet
"Incidence of Invasive Fungal Disease in Patients receiving Immunosuppressive Therapy, Intensive Chemotherapy or Reduced Intensity Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation on Posaconazole Prophylaxis","This study aims to assess the impact of using tablet posaconazole (an anti-fungal agent) on the incidence of invasive fungal disease (IFD) in patients with aplastic anaemia, Myelodysplasia (MDS) or Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) who are undergoing immuosuppressive therapy, intensive chemotherapy or RIC allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).    The study will be open to recruitment for 12 to 24 months.  Participants enrolled on the study will be treated according to standard care with an additional CT scan at study entry (if one has not been performed within two weeks of study entry) and additional blood tests taken at the same time as routine samples.  Clinical, laboratory and radiological information taken as part of normal care will be prospectively collected for this study.  Each patient will be followed up for at least 16 weeks from the last admission for chemotherapy, immunosuppressive therapy or transplant with no ongoing complications such as GVHD.","1.

Phase I study of transfer of effector memory T cells (Tem) following allogeneic stem cell transplantation.,"Healthy bone marrow produces blood cells, including infection-fighting immune cells. These blood cells originate from stem cells. In cancer, the bone marrow can no longer function properly. To restore healthy blood cell production and to fight the cancer, some patients are given healthy stem cells from a donorâs bone marrow. Although this can cure many patients, it can have serious side effects, including âgraft versus host diseaseâ (GvHD). This happens because the bone marrow contains donor immune cells (the âgraftâ) that see the patientâs healthy cells (the âhostâ) as foreign and attacks them. It mainly affects the tissues of the skin, the liver and the gut and can be life threatening. Drugs that prevent GvHD by suppressing the donorâs immune cells in the patientâs body renders the immune system weak and unable to fight infections. These infections are sometimes very severe and can lead to patients dying.     This trial aims to find out if giving patients additional infection fighting immune cells from the donor (Tem cells) will reduce their chance of getting an infection without causing GvHD.    Patients will receive additional donor immune cells about one month after the transplant. They will also receive the standard GvHD prevention treatment. Different doses of the donor immune cells will be given to individual patients to work out which dose is best. All patients will be closely monitored for signs of GvHD or infection. They will also have blood tests to determine how well and quickly their immune systems recover. Patients will be followed up for 12 months post treatment.    The study will recruit a maximum of 18 patients. The study will be conducted at NHS hospitals and is expected to last 22 months.","Patient:  - Severe aplastic anaemia or  - Primary immune deficiency or  - Haematological cancer which can be ONE OF the following:     o Non-Hodgkinâs lymphoma (NHL) in CR or PR;     o Hodgkinâs lymphoma (HL) in CR or PR;     o Chronic (Pro-)lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL or PLL) in CR or PR     o Plasma cell myeloma (PCM) in CR, VGPR or PR;     o Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in CR;     o Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in CR;     o Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) <  10 % blasts in bone marrow;     o Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) <  10% blasts in bone marrow  - Have undergone disease reassessment within 8 weeks prior to registration  - Suitable for HLA-identical sibling transplant using a standard alemtuzumab-based conditioning regimen with calcineurin-inhibitor based immunoprophylaxis  - Aged > =  16 years, < 70 years  - Written informed consent     Donor:  - Aged > =  16 years  - HLA-identical sibling  - Have met transplant centre criteria regarding suitability for cell therapy donation  - Negative for HIV 1 and 2, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HTLV-1 and 2, syphilis serology  - Written informed consent"
"Project Aura: Co-design of a home monitoring solution for patients with anaemia of chronic kidney disease, carers and healthcare professionals to optimise delivery of treatment","The study is sponsored by Entia and funded by Innovate UK. This project is a co-design initiative between the investigator team, patients, carers, and health professionals at Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust.    Entia, in partnership with Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust will develop a patient monitoring solution to optimise delivery of specialist care.  As a part of this service, a medical device will be co-designed which is capable of performing a haemoglobin and haematocrit measurement from a small amount of blood. We hope through this technology to improve the experience of receiving treatment for patients and their carers whilst helping healthcare professionals to plan and manage the care of patients undergoing ESA therapy.    In order to ensure a user-friendly design that meets end user needs, we propose to develop the solution using a co-design model. Patients and carers, along with healthcare professionals and innovators, are all partners in this design process. The co-design process will cover the development of the device, the test and any supporting technology or material if necessary. Participants will be directly involved in bringing a fully functional, innovative service to the market that will improve patients quality of life and aid healthcare professionals when managing anaemia. Entia has led co-design studies previously and will have an active input in the workshops.","For patients  - Age > =  16 years of age  - Adequate English to participate in focus group interview without an interpreter  - Patients of the study site who are currently undergoing treatment for anaemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD)  - Patients should be willing to participate in at least 60-minute and ideally 90-minute focus group discussion at the designated study location, time and date.  - The participant needs to be capable of providing consent or have a suitable, legally acceptable representative present to provide consent before the focus group interview.

Evaluating the Long Term Immunogenicity of  Ebola Virus Vaccines Ad26-ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo,"This study proposes to investigate whether the immune response generated following vaccination with various prime boost regimes of the Ad26-ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo Ebola vaccines is preserved in the long-term. In this study, we aim to assess persistence of humoral and cellular immunity between 24 and 30 months and 36 to 42 months from the date a participant received their prime vaccine.    The humoral response will be assessed by estimating the neutralizing IgG antibodies to the Ebola GP using an in-house ELISA technique. The cellular immune response will be assessed by assessing pro-inflammatory cytokine release by CD8+ and CD4+ T cells using staining techniques on a multicolour flow cytometer platform.     We will also carry out additional tests for cellular immunity, such as IFN-gamma release by Ebola-specific GP-specific T cells by the ELISpot assay. We will store the remaining PBMCs under appropriate conditions for this purpose.","Willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the study  -Male or female, aged 18 or above.  -Subject must have received both vaccines in the phase I trial (14/SC/1408).  -Agree to allow his or her GP (and/or consultant, if appropriate) to be notified of participation in the study if required."
A phase I study to determine the safety and immunogenicity of the candidate Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV) vaccine ChAdOx1 Chik in healthy adult volunteers,"The purpose of this study is to test a new vaccine against the Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV) in healthy volunteers.   Chikungunya fever is a disease caused by CHIKV and it is transmitted to humans through a mosquito bite.  It has been identified in over 100 countries, causing approximately 1 million cases  worldwide. The disease typically consists of an acute illness characterised by fever, skin rash, muscle aches and severe joint pains (which are often incapacitating), lasting weeks to months.  There are currently no available treatments or licensed vaccines and strategies tackling the control of the mosquito are extremely difficult to implement. Fatal cases are rare, but they have been observed in new-born and elderly individuals, as well as in those with medical conditions such as diabetes or cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurologic disorders     The study will enable us to assess the safety of the new vaccine called ChAdOx1 Chik and the extent of the immune response in healthy volunteers. We will do this by giving participants one dose of the vaccine in addition to doing blood tests and collecting information about any symptoms that occur after vaccination. In this study, healthy adult volunteers will receive a single dose of a new candidate vaccine at different doses. The objective of this first-in-human study is to find the optimal dose of the vaccine, balancing immune responses and profile of adverse events.  Healthy volunteers aged 18-50 will be recruited in Oxford and vaccinated at the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine and will be followed for a period of 6 months. The study is funded by the UK innovation agency - Innovate UK and the Department of Health.","The volunteer must satisfy all the following criteria to be eligible for the study:    1.

Vaccine immunogenicity using tuberculosis and dengue fever as models,"It is estimated that in 2015, 10.4 million people were infected with tuberculosis. Dengue Fever infects an estimated 390 million people each year. The current vaccine against TB, the BCG vaccine, and the Dengvaxia vaccine against dengue, only offer partial protection. New vaccines against TB and dengue are urgently needed.   We are testing the effectiveness of new vaccines against tuberculosis and Dengue Fever.  For this project we use tonsils maintained in the laboratory to mimic immune system. These tonsils are used as a platform for testing new vaccines. Human tissue from tonsils is a good model of the complex interactions required to control infectious diseases.   Mice are usually used to test new vaccines. Unfortunately, mice and humans mount different immune responses against tuberculosis. This work will test whether cell lines and human tissue could be a useful alternative to the use of animals in experiments.  Vaccines work by stimulating the immune responses. All vaccines generate different immune responses. To determine which vaccines will be protective, we are measuring the activation of immune cells. We are also monitoring the production of cytokines, which cells use to signal to each other. We are gathering information on the levels of antibody generated by each vaccine. We also measure the survival of immune cells and the elimination of Tuberculosis bacteria.  Testing these parameters for all the vaccines currently in development should allow us to select the most effective new vaccines.","Patients undergoing tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy or uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, as treatment for breathing problems, obstructive sleep apnoea, inflamed tonsils, cancer of the tonsils will be considered potential participants.

Investigating Selective Infection of Glioma Stem Cells by Zika Virus,"We seek permission to analyse surplus specimens resected at craniotomy. We will first separate the tumour into single cells before infecting these specimens with Zika virus tagged with a marker so we can see which cells are infected by it. Following this we will use techniques to characterise the target cell for the virus. We also plan to infect tumour slices for staining.    No additional tissue will be removed from the patient and only tissue surplus to the needs for pathological analysis will be used. Fragments of tissue will  include:  a) Normal brain tissue resected by necessity in the course of the approach to the lesion  b) Lesion margins  c) Lesion bulk  These tissue types may be obtained directly from the surgical field, or indirectly by collecting the waste products from the ultrasonic tissue ablation apparatus used at operation.",Neurosurgery for intrinsic brain tumour necessitating resection.
Evaluating the Long Term Immunogenicity of Ad / MVA Ebola Virus Vaccines following late boosting with AD26.ZEBOV vaccine administered after heterologous prime/boost schedules of adenoviral and MVA vectored Ebola vaccines: an open-label clinical trial,"This study will evaluate the duration of the immune response of a late booster dose of a vaccine against Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), AD26.ZEBOV, in healthy adults previously immunised with investigational Ebola vaccine schedules. This will generate data crucial to the understanding of persistence of immunity after initial immunisation, and whether a late booster dose confers additional benefit in long term persistence of immunity. These data are critical in informing the potential for the investigational vaccines schedules to provide sustained immunity to those at ongoing risk of EVD (e.g. health care workers) and whether this can be significantly altered by the additional dose of AD26.ZEBOV.    To achieve this, participants who have completed previous Phase 1 and 2 Ebola  vaccine studies in the UK including EBL01 (REC 14/SC/1256), EBL04 (REC 15/SC/0108) and EBL05 (REC 15/SC/0267) led by the Oxford Vaccine Centre, will be invited to participate in these âfollow-onâ studies, in which blood tests will be taken at 2 to 5 years after initial immunisation. Participants who are willing to take part in the follow-on study will be invited to receive a booster dose of AD26.ZEBOV, but this is not a requirement of participation. Blood tests will be taken 7 days and 1 month after AD26.ZEBOV in those receiving the booster dose with this vaccine. All participants having a further blood test at one year after enrolment, allowing us to evaluate the persistence of vaccine induced immunity with and without a late booster dose of AD26.ZEBOV.

A phase I study to determine the safety and immunogenicity of the candidate Zika Virus (ZIKV) vaccine ChAdOx1 Zika in healthy adult volunteers given as a stand alone vaccine or co-administered with the Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV) candidate vaccine ChAdOx1 Chik.,"The purpose of this study is to test a new vaccine against the Zika Virus (ZIKV) in healthy volunteers given on its own and at the same time as another new vaccine against Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV).  Zika is a disease caused by ZIKV and can be transmitted to humans through a mosquito bite, from a pregnant woman to their unborn child and it can also be sexually transmitted. Symptoms of Zika infection include fever, headache, joint & muscle pains, tiredness and skin rashes, but most people wonât have any symptoms at all. The disease is now known to be associated with major neurological complications, especially in new-borns, with lifelong consequences.    It became well-known after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Zika epidemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, following the rapid spread of the disease from Latin America in 2016 where several birth defects were associated with Zika infection. More than 85 countries have now reported Zika cases and the disease continues to spread globally. Zika is now part of the WHO list of priority diseases lists for accelerated vaccine research.    Chikungunya fever is a disease caused by CHIKV and it is transmitted to humans through a mosquito bite. It has been identified in over 100 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, Oceania and the Americas. The disease typically consists of an acute illness characterised by fever, skin rash, muscle aches and severe joint pains (which are often incapacitating), lasting weeks to months or in rare cases, years. CHIKV is listed as priority virus by the UK Vaccine Network and the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. It has also been designated as a serious condition requiring action by the WHO to promote Research and Development to control future outbreaks.    There are currently no available specific treatments or licensed vaccines for any of these 2 diseases. The same type of mosquito is involved in the transmission of ZIKV and CHIKV and strategies tackling the control of the mosquito are extremely difficult to implement. The development of new vaccines is the most cost-effective way to fight Zika and Chikungunya.    The study will enable us to assess the safety of new vaccines called ChAdOx1 Zika and ChAdOx1 Chik and the extent of their immune responses in healthy volunteers. We will do this by giving participants a single dose of either one (Zika) or both vaccines (Zika and Chikungunya), in addition to doing blood tests and collecting information about any symptoms that occur after vaccination. This is the first trial to use this Zika vaccine and the second study to use the Chikungunya vaccine in humans. We plan to recruit a maximum of 66 participants to be vaccinated, where half of them will receive the Zika vaccine only and the other half will receive both vaccines.    Healthy volunteers aged 18-50 will be recruited in Oxford and vaccinated at the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine and will be followed for a period of 12 months. The study is funded by the UK Department of Health & Social Care and Innovate UK.","The volunteer must satisfy all the following criteria to be eligible for the study:  1. Healthy adults aged 18 to 50 years  2. Able and willing (in the Investigatorâs opinion) to comply with all study requirements  3.

Safety and Feasibility Evaluation of Tourniquets for Total Knee Replacement Study,The majority of surgeons perform Total Knee Replacement surgery with the aid of a tourniquet. The tourniquet interrupts the blood supply and drainage from the leg and helps to create a bloodless field. A tourniquet may however increase a patientsâ risk of developing a blood clot. At the end of surgery the tourniquet is deflated and blood clots that may have accumulated in the leg are immediately free to flow (embolise) within the blood stream. In some cases blood clots and debris can return to the heart where they are then free to travel to the brain.  The potentially increased risk of clots and debris in the brain associated with using a tourniquet has never been examined with any definitive randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and it is unclear if such a RCT would even be feasible. A feasibility study is therefore planned and will comprise three parts:  i. Pilot randomised controlled trial. Patients due for TKR surgery will invited to take part in a pilot trial and randomised to surgery with or without a tourniquet with a view to recruiting 50 patients. All patients will undergo a Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging scan of their brain before and after surgery to look for evidence of clots and debris in the brain. Other potentially important outcomes including knee pain and function within 12 months will also be collected.  ii. Integrated qualitative research study. An interview study of around 30 patients and around 20 surgeons will capture the views and opinions of both groups regarding the acceptability of the pilot trial.  iii. Retrospective multi-centre cohort study. A study of an existing database of TKR surgery in England and Wales (National Joint Registry-NJR) will be undertaken. The data will be mapped to other existing databases of deaths and hospital reported blood clots.,All patients undergoing an elective primary unilateral cemented total knee replacement (TKR) under the care of four orthopaedic consultants at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire (UHCW) NHS trust are potentially eligible to take part in the pilot RCT.
The Development of New Classification Criteria for Hand Osteoarthritis,"The purpose of this study is to develop a new criteria for distinguishing patients with hand osteoarthritis from other  conditions based on their symptoms and/or x-ray findings. This is a multi-center international study. 200 participants  older than 18 years in age, 100 with hand osteoarthritis and 100 with hand complaints not due to osteoarthritis will be  recruited in nine hospitals worldwide. Twenty-four participants will be recruited in Nottingham, UK. Patients will attend  for a single visit at which they will give information about their joint symptoms, and have examination of their joints.  Blood tests for measuring inflammation and hand radiographs will be performed if this has not been done in the  previous six months. Photograph of both hands will be taken. We anticipate the study visit to take approximately one  hour. The patients' symptoms will be scored on a 1 to 10 scale by a rheumatologist as to whether they are related to  hand osteoarthritis or not. Once data from all participating centers is collected, it will be sent to the main study center  for analysis so that symptoms, signs and x-ray and blood test changes that can differentiate patients with hand  osteoarthritis from other conditions will be identified. Only anonymised information will be sent to the main study  center.     Logistic regression analyses with limited numbers of predictors evaluating which clinical features (independent  variables) discriminate between OA and not OA (dependent variable) using data from 50 patients. A list of potentially  relevant features and categories within each feature for classifying an individual as having (or not having) hand OA will  be developed. The 1000Minds software (www.1000Minds.com) will be used to develop a weighting scheme for these  features with the goal of identifying a set of criteria that provide a range of probability (from 0 to 100%) of hand OA.","Age â¥18 years   Hand symptoms e.g. pain with or without stiffness, restriction of movement due to arthritis for at least six weeks   Diagnosed with OA of hands or any other arthritis affecting their hands   Ability to give informed consent"
WHISTL:ER. Follow up of hip arthroplasty long term:Effect on Revision,"After a hip replacement, some patients are offered long term follow up of their new joint and others are not.   A follow  up is offered to check the joint for any sign of potential failure.   Many patients appreciate the reassurance but it is not  known if this service, hip arthroplasty surveillance, has any effect on the outcome when a revision of the hip  replacement is needed.   This is a pilot study to examine the effect of hip arthroplasty surveillance on the patient  reported outcome and the cost to the health service after revision of a hip replacement.  The group of patients who will be asked to participate are those about to have an operation to revise a hip  replacement.   It will not include those patients who have an infection in their hip joint.   It will take place in one large  orthopaedic unit over a twelve month period.   Each participant will be asked to complete a questionnaire before they  have their operation, six months after their operation and twelve months after the operation.   Information from the  medical records and from the questionnaires will be used to answer the study question.   The results from the pilot  study will indicate if a larger study is needed in a variety of orthopaedic units.",Adults listed for revision of a primary hip arthroplasty  â¢ Revision of acetabular or femoral or both components of a hip arthroplasty
Multi -Centre Clinical Study Comparing the Clinical and Patient Reported   Outcomes of the Vanguard XP Knee System to the Vanguard CR Knee System,"Knee replacement surgery is a common treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee. There are  different types of knee replacement systems, or âimplantsâ, that can be used in the surgery. The  research looking at modifications and design changes to these implants is limited. Research is  needed to consider the changing characteristics of the patients who require knee surgery.  Currently there is an increase in demand for knee replacement in a younger and more active  population, who desire less limitation on their activities following knee replacement surgery.  Current knee replacement designs sacrifice one of the main ligaments in the knee, called the  Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL). By preserving natural knee structures, such as the ACL, it is  thought that the knee will retain more normal function following surgery.  The Vanguard CR is a commonly used knee replacement, and it sacrifices the ACL. Zimmer  Biomet have developed a new knee replacement implant called the Vanguard XP which keeps all  the main knee ligaments intact. This new design may benefit the younger, more active  population.  ALLIKAT is a research study which will evaluate the early outcomes of the Vanguard XP  compared to the Vanguard CR. Patients will be followed up for 3 years, with information about  complications both during and following the surgery, as well as patient reported outcomes. 200  patients will be randomised to receive either the Vanguard CR or the Vanguard XP, and they will  not know which one they receive. There will also be a smaller group of 60 participants who will  only receive the Vanguard XP. The data from this cohort group will contribute to safety and  efficacy evaluation of the new implant. 260 patients will be recruited in total from 5-6 NHS sites  around the UK.  Non-identifiable data collected from the cohort group combined with the data from those  randomised to the Vanguard XP will contribute to the Beyond Compliance Program which has  been set up in the interest of patients, to support the safe and stepwise introduction of new or  modified medical implants such as joint replacements.",Primary Osteoarthritis of the knee involving one or more compartments of the joint  Intact Anterior and Posterior Cruciate Ligaments  Intact collateral ligaments  Correctable coronal deformity  No more than 15 degrees of fixed flexion deformity
A Longitudinal study investigating whether Patient Reported Outcome Measures at day of discharge and 3-weeks Post  Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) predict outcomes at 12-months post-operatively?,"Title: Early PROMPT Study  Background Approximately 20% of patients are not satisfied after Total knee replacement (Wylde et al, 2011). However,  it remains a challenge to reliably identify the candidates who will do well and who will not following TKA (Lungu et al,  2014a). Studies which have looked at the predictive value of pre-operative factors have not been able to establish clear  guidelines on this issue (Desmeules et al, 2013, Lungu et al 2014b, Wylde et al, 2007). Post-operatively, it appears  the first 12-week period is a critical phase of recovery as pain, function and satisfaction studies have shown that persistent problems remaining at 12-weeks post-operatively are predictive of problems at 1 year (Mitsuyasu et al,  2011Í¾ Williams et al, 2013).   Very few studies have analysed whether there are factors present in the first 6-weeks post  op, which reliably predict long term outcomes. Logically, the earlier patients at risk of problems are identified, the more  chance there is to provide interventions which reduce the negative impact of them (Williams et al, 2013).  Purpose: This study is aiming to identify whether variables at day of discharge and 3-weeks post TKA predict  outcomes at 1 year post-operatively.   Methods: 200 patients will be consented at their pre-operative appointment and then seen on their day of discharge  from Hospital following Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty to complete the Outcome Measures Booklet. They will be given  an extra copy with to take home with them. At 3-weeks post-opÍ¾ the patient will be phoned to remind them to return the  booklet.   At 12-months, the patient will be sent the booklet for a final time via the post with a SAE.  Outcomes: The main aim is to determine whether patient reported outcomes at day of discharge and 3-weeks post  TKA predict outcomes at 12-months post-operatively.",Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty or Uni-compartmental Knee Arthroplasty for Osteoarthritis only  Age over 55 years old
Osteoarthritis Thumb Therapy trial. A randomised controlled trial into the effectiveness and efficacy of splints in thumb base osteoarthritis.,"Symptomatic thumb base OA affects 20% of the population over 55 years, causing more pain, work disability, reduced  quality of life and function than OA elsewhere in the hand. International experts recommend splinting for hand OA but  there is limited evidence from robust trials to support this.    OTTER II is a multicentre, single blind, randomised controlled clinical effectiveness and efficacy trial. Occupational  therapy and physiotherapy centres in England will recruit participants aged 30 years and over with clinical thumb base  OA. People with symptomatic thumb base OA and moderate to severe thumb base pain will be allocated to either 8  weeks of self-managementÍ¾ 8 weeks of self-management plus a verum splint, or 8 weeks of self-management plus a  sham splint. Follow up will be for 12 weeks from baseline.The primary outcome is the AUSCAN hand pain scale. The  study end point is 8 weeks. Outcomes will be collected at baselineÍ¾ 4 weeksÍ¾ 8 weeksÍ¾ and 12 weeks. Findings will  improve the management of thumb base OA and add to understanding contextual aspects of rehabilitation and selfmanagement  strategies for OA.    The study design builds on experience of conducting the OTTER pilot study and the practical implications for  supporting clinicians across the UK to recruit into and deliver a fully powered randomised control effectiveness and  efficacy trial. This design is a straightforward pragmatic design that will be able to be supported by NHS out-patient  clinics and associated booking procedures throughout the NHS.  The study has been informed by patients and the public and is designed according to the recommendations for the  conduct of randomised controlled trials of osteoarthritis [63, 64].","Males and females aged 30 years and over  Â· At least moderate AUSCAN hand pain (AUSCAN Hand pain score >5) and functional hand disability  (AUSCAN hand functional disability score >9)  Â· Fulfilling clinical symptoms for thumb base OA, - thumb base pain, aching or stiffness, hard tissue  enlargement of the first carpometacarpal joint (CMCJ)Í¾ squaring of the thumb baseÍ¾ positive grind test.
