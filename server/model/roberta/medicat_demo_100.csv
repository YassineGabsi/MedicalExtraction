17,"Congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities",Congenital malformations and deformations of the musculoskeletal system,"An exploratory, open label, multiple dose, multicentre phase I/II trial evaluating safety and efficacy of postnatal or prenatal and postnatal intravenous administration of allogeneic expanded fetal mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of severe Osteogenesis Imperfecta compared with a combination of historical and untreated prospective controls.","The BOOSTB4 trial aims to investigate whether administration of allogeneic (un-matched) fetal mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs, ""BOOST cells"") are a safe and effective treatment for severe types of Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI). BOOST cells will be given either after birth to babies with OI or before birth to babies in the womb (fetus) that have a confirmed molecular diagnosis of OI. OI patients suffer with repeated painful fractures, bony deformities and short stature. There are no treatments for this debilitating condition which target the underlying pathology. In preclinical (animal) studies, MSCs improve the growth and reduce the fracture rate and bone fragility in mice with OI. MSCs have been administered to a small number of fetuses and babies with OI who appear to have had better outcomes than would otherwise have been expected. Worldwide, MSCs have been used to treat many other conditions and appear to be safe, with no evidence of tumour formation and few side effects. We aim to give the BOOST MSCs to 15 babies aged up to 12 months of age (Part 1) and 15 fetuses at 16-35+6 weeks of gestational age (Part 2). The babies or fetuses will each receive a total of 4 doses of MSC, given four months apart. For fetal (prenatal) participants, the first dose will be given as an ultrasound-guided injection into the umbilical cord. Short term follow up will be for 1 year, with long term follow up until 10 years after 1st dose (or age 10 for prenatal participants). Participants will be matched with prospective or historical untreated OI control patients. The trial is sponsored by the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden. Within the UK, the study will be conducted at University College London Hospital and Great Ormond Street Hospital. There are 3 additional sites within Europe.","Postnatal group Infants diagnosed with OI type III or severe OI type IV postnatally and prenatally diagnosed cases who did not consent to prenatal administration. 1.

9,Diseases of the circulatory system,Pulmonary heart disease and diseases of pulmonary circulation,Investigation into conductive and arrhythmogenic properties of the right atrium and ventricle in patients with pulmonary hypertension,"Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is a common and important clinical condition with a significant degree of associated morbidity and mortality. Much of this is due to the high incidence of cardiac arrhythmias in these patients, the presence of which have been shown to correlate with worse prognosis. Very little is understood about the mechanisms underlying these arrhythmias however. We plan to study the heart muscle conduction characteristics of patients with PH undergoing ablation procedures as part of their clinical care. Firstly, using wires (catheters) inserted peripherally via the femoral vein and passed up to the heart we can create a 3 dimensional map of the heart using specialised software. These catheters are also capable of measuring local electrical activation in heart tissue with which they are in contact. We can thus create a model of electrical activation and map areas of scar in the heart chambers of interest. Secondly, a group of PH patients undergoing MRI scans of the heart for clinical purposes will be identified for non-invasive mapping using novel Electrocardiographic Imaging (ECGI) technology. This involves wearing a multi-electrode vest for the duration of the MRI scan and a short period before or after. Using anatomical information gleaned from the scan and electrical information gleaned from the multi-electrode vest a similar 3 dimensional map of the heart can be created without the need for invasive catheter manipulation. By identifying and characterising arrhythmia mechanisms in patients with PH we hope to better understand how these arrhythmias arise, how they correlate to prognosis and how to target therapy appropriately.","All patients with pulmonary hypertension who are scheduled to undergo an EP study and ablation procedure, or cardiac MRI scan will be eligible."
2,Neoplasms,"Malignant neoplasms, stated or presumed to be primary, of lymphoid, haematopoietic and related tissue","A prospective, multicentre European Registry for newly diagnosed patients with Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS), including acute myeloid leukaemia with 20-30 percent marrow blasts (former RAEB-t), and Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukaemia (CMML).","The European MDS Registry (EUMDS) started as an observational pan-European study aiming to prospectively collect longitudinal data from a large number of lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients in April 2008. The registry has evolved into a valuable source containing data on diagnostics, demographics, clinical parameters, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), disease-management and outcome of over 2000 newly diagnosed lower-risk (IPSS low and intermediate-1) MDS patient across 142 centres in 17 countries. In a number of these countries, national MDS Registration projects are ongoing aiming at improving the knowledge of the local incidence and management of these patients. The EUMDS registry serves as a central international registry, using the national MDS Registries that are represented within the European LeukemiaNet MDS Working Party (ELN WP8) as the platform for registration, to study the demographics, disease-management and treatment outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed MDS more comprehensively. The aim in the next phase of the EUMDS Registry is to extend the current registry to a general MDS registry including higher-risk (IPSS intermediate-2 and high-risk), therapy-related MDS and MDS-F, AML with 20-30 percent marrow blasts (former RAEB-t), CMML and other forms of mixed MDS/MPD.",Patients must meet all of the following criteria to be included in the European MDS Registry: - Age > 18 years - Newly diagnosed patient (within 100 days from the date of the diagnostic BM aspirate) -MDS classified according to current WHO criteria (both 2008 [8] and 2016 [10] will be recorded)3 - All sub groups of MDS -Therapy-related MDS -MDS with Fibrosis (MDS-F) -AML with 20-30 percent marrow blasts (former RAEB-t) -CMML and other forms of mixed MDS/MPD -IPSS and IPSS-R Risk group classification (mandatory)4 -Able and willing to provide the written informed consent
1,Certain infectious and parasitic diseases,Infections with a predominantly sexual mode of transmission,A Point of care antimicrobial resistance test for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Mycoplasma genitalium infection â ensuring accurate therapy and antibiotic stewardship in sexual health medicine.,"Testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) enables diagnosis and appropriate clinical management of individuals, thus preventing serious health consequences. It is an important public health intervention with potential to reduce onward transmission of infection to sexual partners, and reducing the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). New technologies, including point of care tests (POCTs), especially those that combine detection of the pathogen and AMR, may help overcome challenges of STI prevention by enabling immediate diagnosis and appropriate treatment, improving partner notification, quality of patient care and antibiotic stewardship. Through a three-year NIHR i4i-funded grant (II-LB-0214-20005), the team at St Georgeâs University of London have been working with Atlas Genetics, to develop a POCT for diagnosis and AMR for the two STIs Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Mycoplasma genitalium (MG). We are now able to conduct a prospective diagnostic accuracy study of the test using patient-consented (additional to routine) clinical samples, to evaluate the Atlas io platforms and its associated cartridges. For NG, the primary outcome is to set the detection level whereby samples are considered negative and assess the testâs utility as a reflex test for patients already diagnosed with NG. For MG, we will look at the accuracy of detection and AMR. Secondary outcomes are an epidemiological description of the recruited population, and modelling clinical impact of POCTs. We will work with Atlas Genetics and a number of UK NHS Genitourinary Medicine (GUM) clinics, over 12 months. Following informed consent, females will be asked to provide 2 additional vulvo-vaginal swabs, males an additional portion of first void urine, and men-who-have-sex-with men (MSM) two additional pharyngeal and rectal swabs. The results of the tests will not be used to inform patient care. Participants will only be recruited during one routine clinical visit, no follow up is required.","i) Males and females attending the GUM clinic who are being routinely tested for STIs, including CT and NG (NAATs), as part of their standard care ii) Able to provide written, informed consent; iii) Willing and able to provide: f) Males: The residual of the first catch urine (FCU) sample, minimum 20ml (i.e. (first > = 20ml of the initial urine stream, with the patient not passing urine in the previous 2 hours) g) Females: Three self- or healthcare professional-collected vulvovaginal swabs (VVS) (1 routine collected first, 2 additional-to-routine in eNAT medium (order determined by patient/healthcare professional)) h) MSM: Four healthcare professional-collected pharyngeal swabs (2 routine collected first, 2 additional-to-routine in eNAT medium (order determined by healthcare professional)) i) MSM: Four self- or healthcare professional-collected rectal swabs in eNAT medium (2 routine collected first, 2 additional-to-routine in eNAT medium (order determined by patient/healthcare professional)) iv) Symptomatic or contact of someone with CT/NG/MG/NSU; and v) Patients aged 16 years or over.

5,Mental and behavioural disorders,Mood [affective] disorders,Professional satisfaction and wellbeing among specialty trainees in Anaesthesia within the Southwest of England and Wales; a mixed-methods collaborative study.,"Background Anaesthesia as a medical specialty often produces high levels of professional satisfaction. Despite this, 30% of UK anaesthetists feel stressed âa lot of the timeâ and 5% feel stressed âall the timeâ. For anaesthetists and trainee anaesthetists, high stress levels can lead to depression and burnout syndrome (consisting of emotional exhaustion, having an unfeeling response to oneâs patients and having a sense that oneâs work lacks value). Anaesthetic trainees who experience burnout are more likely to make medication errors and practice less safely, increasing the risk of harm to their patients. Stress, depression and burnout syndrome have never been properly explored in UK anaesthetic trainees. This represents an important safety issue, both for these doctors and the patients they treat. Aims 1. To establish the prevalence of stress, depression and burnout syndrome among anaesthetic trainees within Southwest England and Wales. 2. To identify and explore the potential factors which contribute to these traits. Methods This study is a collaboration between three regional trainee-led research groups. Firstly, we will send a confidential electronic questionnaire to all anaesthetic trainees in Severn, Peninsula and Wales Deaneries (approximately 600). This will collect demographic data and also use well-validated assessment tools to measure the prevalence of depression, burnout, stress and job satisfaction. Secondly, an experienced psychologist will carry out optional and confidential telephone interviews on a sample of those who score both high and low in domains of stress, depression and/or burnout, in order to identify potential contributing and protective factors. Potential Benefits of the Study This study will provide current, accurate information for those involved in educating, supervising and managing UK anaesthetic trainees and may identify opportunities for the modification or management of risk factors implicated in the development of stress, depression or burnout syndrome.","Specialty Trainee in Anaesthesia (+/- Intensive Care Medicine) within Southwest England (Severn and Peninsula Training Deaneries) or Wales (Wales Deanery).

4,"Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases",Diabetes mellitus,Investigating how platelet-derived oncogenic microRNAs (miRNAs) are altering the genetics of breast cancer cells.,"This application is for approval to gain a blood sample from diabetic patients recruited by our clinical collaborator Dr Donald Whitelaw at his clinic. We have funding from the charity Breast Cancer Now to run a three year PhD research project entitled âInvestigating how platelet-derived oncogenic miRNAs are altering the genetics of breast cancer cellsâ. Diabetes is a strong risk factor for developing aggressive, rapidly spreading forms of breast cancer. We have preliminary data demonstrating that platelet blood cells in diabetic patients release small particles (microparticles) that contain specialised chemicals (miRNAs) which may help to promote cancer growth responses. This project will extract microparticles from diabetic patients blood to study how they promote cancer growth responses, and will identify which miRNAs found in the particles from diabetic donors help cancer development.","Adult female diabetic donors with a current active complication of diabetes(Cardiovascular disease,neuropathy, nephropathy or a foot ulcer). The control group of healthy, non-diabetic donors, will be recruited from Bradford University and blood samples will be taken by Bradford University staff at the university."
4,"Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases",Diabetes mellitus,A pilot randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy of sitagliptin in reducing depressive symptoms in patients with comorbid type 2 diabetes and depression,"One in 5 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) has depression. Patients with depression and T2D have more chance of getting complications related to their diabetes (such as stroke and heart attack) and of dying early. However, the reasons for this are not well understood and current treatments for depression do not improve these poor outcomes. Sitagliptin is an established medication for T2D that acts to reduce blood sugars. In addition, Sitagliptin acts to reduce inflammation â the bodyâs normal response to infections but which, if elevated for a long time, may worsen both T2D and depression. In a study of 1735 patients with T2D, we recently observed that those receiving Sitagliptin and related medications experienced an improvement in depression. This improvement correlated with reduction in levels of inflammation, suggesting that Sitagliptin may improve depression by reducing inflammation. We therefore propose a pilot clinical trial of Sitagliptin in 60 patients with T2D and depression. Participants will be recruited from GP surgeries in Lambeth, Southwark and Lewisham. Participants will be randomised to receive either Sitagliptin or placebo daily for 12 weeks. Neither participants nor the trial team will know which treatment any patient is receiving. Before starting treatment and every 4 weeks thereafter, participants will answer two depression questionnaires and have blood tests to measure inflammation and blood sugar control. Although treatment will stop after 12 weeks, participants will continue to be monitored every 4 weeks for a further 12 weeks for depression levels. Participants will be seen at Kingâs College Hospital or their own GP surgery. We propose that Sitagliptin will lead significant improvement in depressive symptoms compared to placebo. If successful, this study will provide the first trial evidence that inflammation is important in the depression of T2D and provide the basis for a larger clinical trial.","1.

4,"Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases",Other nutritional deficiencies,Limited exposure narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) to face and arms using a portable lamp in healthy volunteers and patients with vitamin D insufficiency.,"An adequate vitamin D supply is crucial for bone health and may be important in the prevention of certain cancers and autoimmune diseases. At present vitamin D deficiency is common worldwide. In the UK this condition frequently affects people especially in winter when vitamin D synthesis induced by the sun is zero. Solar ultraviolet (UV) exposure is the major source of vitamin D and as much as 90% of all vitamin D has to be formed in the skin. Narrowband UVB (NB-UVB) is a safe and effective method of stimulating vitamin D production, and it is impossible to overdose. This is the first study of short burst, limited exposure to forearms and face at home using a portable lamp. In most patients oral vitamin D supplementation is well tolerated and effective, but there is a minority who will not tolerate or absorb oral vitamin D. In the proposed study we will examine whether a seven day course of NB-UVB to hands and face improves vitamin D balance in winter in healthy volunteers and patients with vitamin D insufficiency, and whether this approach might be feasible, tolerated and acceptable to patients. In later studies we intend to assess if the technique can be used in nursing homes, in Crohn's disease and other causes of malabsorption and other chronic diseases which restrict sunlight exposure.",Patients and healthy volunteers with vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency (25OHD3 < 50nmol/L) will be recruited between November and April 2016/7 - Skin type II and III - No more than 400IU (10mg) vitamin D supplementation during the two preceding months. - Willing and able to provide written informed consent - Able to understand/communicate in English
4,"Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases",Obesity and other hyperalimentation,What is the impact of a modified Roux-en-Y-gastric bypass operation on people with type 2 diabetes mellitus? The LONG LIMB-2 double-blinded randomised controlled clinical trial,"The profound improvement in glucose control after Roux-en-Y-gastric bypass (RYGB) has led to the recognition of the intestine as a major player in glucose regulation. The optimal length of each of the three limbs (alimentary, biliopancreatic and common) remains controversial. This is further complicated by the differences in total small intestinal length in humans (ranging between 3.5-10.5 meters). Anatamical arrangements of RYGB results in three segments or ""limbs"": 1. ""Alimentary limb"" through which food enters the small intestine through a gastric pouch (the remnant of the stomach) 2. ""Biliopancreatic limb"" which includes the bypassed segments of the duodenum (first section of the small intestine) and proximal jejunum (second section) through which the biliopancreatic (bile acids from the gall bladder and pancreatic) secretions flow and 3. ""Common limb"" in which the food and biliopancreatic secretions mix. Current evidence supports the hypothesis that a ""modified"" RYGB with a long alimentary limb and short common limb may optimize glucose control. There have not been any clinical trials comparing ""modified"" and ""standard"" RYGB with glucose control as primary outcome. In this study, we propose to recruit 80 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and obesity who are eligible for metabolic surgery and currently on the waiting list for bariatric surgery at Imperial College London Healthcare NHS Trust obesity service. Randomisation will take place intra-operatively in patients with a total small intestinal length < 5.5 meters. The surgeon will contact the randomiser who will make the allocation to either ""modified"" or ""standard"" RYGB before continuing with the surgery. Research will take place at Imperial College London NHS Trust. Participants will attend 5 visits in total (baseline, day 10, 3, 6 and 12 months post operatively) for anthropometric measurements, blood tests, urine pregnancy test, assessment of number of glucose lowering medications and adverse event profile.",â¢ Diagnosis of T2DM â¢ BMI > 30 kg/m2 â¢ Age 18-65 years â¢ Eligible for metabolic/bariatric surgery as per NICE CG189
7,Diseases of the eye and adnexa,Visual disturbances and blindness,"Binocular vision, visual function and pupil dynamics in people living with dementia: Exploring their relationships to rate of cognitive decline and structural changes within the brain","Some types of memory problems can change your ability to judge distances. This is called depth perception. It can be measured with some simple and easy tests, which are used in hospitals all the time. Problems with depth perception can lead to double vision, headaches and sore eyes. These problems can also increase risk of falling, make hand-eye tasks harder, and cause distress. Right now, testing depth perception is not included in current dementia-friendly eyetest guidelines. We donât know how common depth perception problems are amongst people with dementia, or whether they interact with other eye-related markers of dementia, like changes in the pupil (the black middle part of the eye), or letter chart vision. We also donât know if changes in these things over time match up with changes in memory test scores, sleep quality, or the visual areas of the brain on scans. We want to test up to 210 people with a recent dementia diagnosis (within last 18 months), who attend Surrey and Borders Partnership community clinics. They'll complete a sleep questionnaire and some eye tests three times over an 8 month period to see if their depth perception, letter chart vision and pupil functions change in this time, and whether these relate to any changes in memory test scores or sleep quality. For 30 people with Alzheimerâs Disease, we will invite them to have a brain scan (magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) and wear a sleep-tracker after the first and final visit. This sees if changes in their test results relate to changes in visual areas of the brain. If we find these simple, non-invasive tests of eyesight can predict dementia progression, including depth perception testing within dementia-friendly eyetests would be helpful. Eye testing could present an alternative way of monitoring progression of dementia.","All participants (maximum n = 210): â¢ Confirmed diagnosis, within last 18 months, of Alzheimerâs disease, vascular dementia, mixed Alzheimerâs/vascular dementia, Lewy Body dementia or posterior cortical atrophy. â¢ Attending community mental health (CMH) clinics at Surrey and Borders Partnership (SABP) NHS sites â¢ Baseline corrected visual acuity < = 0.300 logMAR bilaterally â i.e. no visual impairment1 â¢ No pathology affecting pupil function, e.g. ocular trauma â¢ No history of childhood amblyopia/strabismus â¢ No history of alcohol/substance misuse â¢ No significant neurological/psychiatric history excluding dementia, e.g. focal brain lesion, schizophrenia â¢ Not currently taking miotic/mydriatic medications (e.g. for glaucoma) â¢ Not currently taking medication likely to significantly impair cognitive function (e.g. sedatives, antipsychotics) â¢ Spectacles, if worn, are up-to-date prescription (within last 2 years) â¢ Fundus and media check within last 12 months, permitted diagnoses: no apparent defect, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, cataract (if not met, to be arranged prior to first study visit with The Outside Clinic or other provider of patientâs choice, costs reimbursed) Subset of PWD receiving MRI (n=30, comprising suitable sub-sample for pilot study13): â¢ Capacity to give informed consent at baseline scan, as determined by 3-Item capacity questionnaire (this criterion is in place for this subset of participants due to the requirement for the person with dementia to be alone in the scanner room during the scan and only able to be addressed by intercom). â¢ No contra-indications for MRI e.g. embedded metals, history of significant claustrophobia or previous panic or claustrophobia while in an MRI scanner â¢ Confirmed diagnosis, within last 18 months, of Alzheimerâs disease â dementia type selected for established structural MRI disease progression markers"
10,Diseases of the respiratory system,Chronic lower respiratory diseases,Assessment of the asthma specific emotional profile in individuals with asthma and their partners,"Asthma is a disease with a variety of causes, severity and response to treatment. There is research evidence that patients whose asthma is less well controlled suffer higher levels of anxiety and depression compared to healthy people. Research has also shown that individuals with asthma who suffer from psychological distress have worse asthma and poorer self-management. Interventions addressing these psychological disorders have, however, not led to improved asthma control. One possible reason is that increased anxiety and depression arise due to a range of differing emotions. As such, it is important to understand what 'basic emotions' are present in relationship to asthma, such as fear, disgust, sadness or anger and whether these differ from patient to patient. It is also important to understand how they change, through assessing whether there is difference between these emotions and/or their intensity when the asthma is stable and when it flares up. Informal carers of chronically ill patients have also been shown to have increased levels of psychological disorders. Patients and partners can be looked at as one functional unit, so called 'dyad' where one partner's well-being impacts on the other's and vica versa. Therefore it is also important to understand the partners' psychological processes similarly to that of the patients. This study will use questionnaires to identify participantsâ asthma specific emotions and measure their intensities together with levels of anxiety and depression and perceived asthma control. Participants will be asked to complete two sets of questionnaires , one when the asthmatic partner is in stable condition and one when the disease worsens. Patients and partners will be asked to complete the questionnaires independently in their own homes and return them to the researchers by freepost. Returning the completed questionnaires will imply consenting to the study.",Patients with asthma or partners of individuals living with asthma Minimum 18 years of age
1,Certain infectious and parasitic diseases,Intestinal infectious diseases,"Combatting Bacterial Resistance in Europe â Clostridium difficile Infections (COMBACTE-CDI), understanding the burden of disease","Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most common cause of antibiotic associated diarrhoea in the western world. The infection causes significant diarrhoea, which in some cases can be serious and lead to secondary complications and even death. The infection is particularly an issue in elderly, frail patient, who are often already burdened with several other medical issues. Recent work has demonstrated that numerous cases are missed, either due to inadequate diagnostic tests or lack of clinical suspicion. The public-private partnership in COMBACTE-CDI will quantify the burden of CDI via a large, complex, multi-centre, multi-country study, and describe current management practices. An increased understanding of the CDI burden across Europe and better understanding of transmission of the organism will provide a basis for the further development of public health interventions and practices. Based on a previous successful study model (EUCLID), hospitals/laboratories of interest which carry out diagnostic testing of samples from both in-patients and community patients (including Long-Term Care Facilities patients) will be approached for inclusion in the study. Samples sent to the sites on the selected study date (regardless of test requested) will be tested at a central laboratory for CDI to look for missed cases of CDI. A follow up case/control study will collect data on outcomes and risk factors. Data will be used to construct transmission models and cost effective-ness models. Ultimately, a best practice model for CDI management will be developed.",Sample study ALL unformed faecal samples (takes the shape of the container and/or stick will not remain vertical when inserted into the sample) from ALL patients (ALL ages) sent to the microbiology department of participating sites on their allotted testing day (irrespective of test requested).

2,Neoplasms,Malignant neoplasms of digestive organs,Improving patient experience and outcomes in bowel cancer screening.,"Bowel cancer is the second most deadly cancer in the UK, killing on average 16,000 people each year. Cancer occurs as a result of changes, or âmutationsâ, in the DNA within cells. Currently, if a patient undergoes a biopsy or if the whole tumour is surgically removed (resection), this tissue can be tested for the presence of mutations. Tumours release tiny amounts of DNA and cells into the blood and stool, which can also be tested for the presence of mutations. Being able to detect these mutations will improve our ability to screen for the presence of cancer, provide information about a patientâs diagnosis and determine which treatment options are best for each patient. We have the opportunity to collaborate with two industrial partners to improve both the isolation of cancer cells from blood and stool samples and also the screening of these cells for the presence of mutations. Mikro Biyo have developed a novel technology which separates out circulating tumour cells (CTCs) and potentially circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) from patient blood samples. The benefits of this technique are the sensitivity and also the speed with which the blood can be processed. Genefirst have developed âATOM-seqâ, a super-sensitive technology, allowing the processing and sequencing of tiny amounts of the tumour DNA from patient blood and stool samples, to identify mutations. This novel technology could be implemented downstream of the CTC and ctDNA isolation, thus complementing the Mikro Biyo technology. We wish to obtain surplus tumour tissue, blood samples and stool samples from patients with bowel cancer, to compare the mutation profile of each sample type. We also wish to obtain stool samples from patients who have undergone a colonoscopy, to determine whether âATOM-seqâ could be used to further identify patients âat riskâ of cancer development.","All participants: - Aged between 18 and 115. - Able to give informed consent. - English literate (information sheet and consent forms will only be produced in English, due to financial constraints). For the 500 patients we would like to collect blood samples and a surplus tumour sample from: - Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of bowel cancer (ICD-10 code C18, C19 or C20). For the 1500 patients we would like to collect a stool sample and a surplus tissue sample from: - Patients who have undergone a colonoscopy, and have a known result."
4,"Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases",Metabolic disorders,Establishment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the airways of people with cystic fibrosis,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetically inherited disease requiring complex life-long medical treatment. People with CF have a shortened life expectancy. The median predicted survival in 2013 was 36.6 years. Although many organs in the body are affected, most morbidity and mortality is due to damage to the lungs caused by long-term bacterial infections requiring extensive treatment with antibiotics. Our previous work has demonstrated that the upper airways are important in the initial stages of bacterial infection. We believe that the upper respiratory tract in patients are key sites in which the bacteria adapts over time, before seeding down to establish in the lungs, and that nasal swabs could therefore be used for the earlier detection of bacterial pathogens. In addition, the use of new, portable sequencing technology (portable Nanopore sequencing) could significantly reduce the time to result from respiratory samples such as respiratory swabs and sputum samples, and permit analysis of sputum samples within the CF clinic, or potentially even at home, reducing the risk of Pseudomonas infection within the clinical environment. This combination of nasal swabbing as an early diagnostic tool and rapid sequencing for the identification of bacteria offers the potential for a prolonged and better targeted window for antibiotic therapy, leading to more successful eradication. The study would involve CF patients attending routine outpatient clinics or inpatients stays. From each patient a sputum sample/respiratory swab and a nasal swab would be taken at each attendance at clinic. The sample collection will be ongoing for up to 2.5 years although we envisage that most samples will be taken in the first year and all analysis will be completed within 5 years. This project could have real impact at a life-changing point in the long term disease management and outlook of CF patients.",Confirmed diagnosis of CF
6,Diseases of the nervous system,Other degenerative diseases of the nervous system,Investigating aspects of the eye and retina in people with Down's syndrome as potential biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease related change.,"People with Downâs syndrome (DS) have a very high prevalence for the early-onset of Alzheimerâs disease (AD). 100% of people show the neuropathological hallmarks of the disease in the brain and typically 40% of individuals are diagnosed with dementia by the fourth decade. It is well established that changes in the brain precede the clinical symptoms of AD by years or decades, identifying more precise markers of change will allow clinical trials to determine efficacy of therapeutics faster and more efficiently, greatly improving the process of Alzheimerâs drug research. Research in the retinas of patients with AD have shown marked decrease in retinal thinning in those with the disease, compared to healthy age-matched adults, and some research has suggested that retinal changes could precede those in the brain. Research from this group has identified a thicker retina in people with DS in comparison to age-matched controls, furthermore, typical age-related thinning patterns were not observed in the DS group. In order to establish the nature of these features in the DS retina, further investigations in the eye are proposed. People with DS have lifelong over-production of amyloid-beta (AÎ²), a protein highly implicated in AD. Part of the investigations in this study are to image AÎ² deposits in the retina. This Alzheimerâs Research UK funded study will use non-invasive retinal imaging methods to investigate retinal structure and features in an adult cohort of people with DS. This study will also provide longitudinal retinal thickness data in a subset of participants who have previously participated in studies with this research group.

2,Neoplasms,Malignant neoplasm of breast,Role of ABUS as an alternative to breast MRI in assessing response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy,"Some women who have been diagnosed with a breast cancer will require chemotherapy as part of their treatment. The chemotherapy can be given before breast surgery â neoadjuvant chemotherapy or after breast surgery â adjuvant chemotherapy. Whether chemotherapy is given before or after does not affect the clinical outcomes for the woman â ie there is no disadvantage to the woman. Due to the fact that giving chemotherapy before has no disadvantages, many of the oncologists like to give the chemotherapy before because they can see if the breast cancer is responding. They are able to do this by using imaging. The best imaging test is breast MRI. Ultrasound can be used but studies have shown that it is not as good. However, whole breast ultrasound (ABUS) provides 3dimensional information similar to breast MRI and the purpose of our study is to see if ABUS performs similar to breast MRI in being able to see if a tumour is responding to the chemotherapy. The breast MRI requires women to lie facing down and takes about 20mins. It involves an injection of contrast called gadolinium via a cannula. ABUS involves scanning the whole breast with the patient lying on their back and takes 10mins. There is no injection of contrast. MRI is an expensive test and often there is limited access to the scanner and so patients may have to wait for an appointment. ABUS because it is an automated process for obtaining the images can be performed in the breast unit in a timely manner without the issue of competing demands. All women who agree to take part in the study will have both the breast MRI - standard care and ABUS.",Inclusion criteria: 1.All female participants eligible for neoadjuvant chemotherapy and planning surgical treatment 2.

10,Diseases of the respiratory system,Acute upper respiratory infections,REspiratory Syncytial virus Consortium in EUrope (RESCEU) study: Defining the burden of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) disease.,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes severe respiratory disease in babies, the elderly and high-risk groups. In 2005 itâs estimated that RSV was associated with 3.4 million acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) hospitalisations and between 55,000 - 199,000 deaths in children under 5 years worldwide, most in developing countries. In the UK up to 1 in 25 of all children born each year are hospitalised due to RSV infection. Knowing the healthcare and societal costs associated with RSV infection are essential to decide which future treatments and preventatives to use. This study will determine the burden of RSV disease in at least 2000 healthy infants, to be recruited into one of two cohorts: 1. Passive (at least 1800): Demographic data will be collected at inclusion and a parental questionnaire at one year of age. Babies admitted to a hospital for an ARTI will be followed up to the age of 3 years. 2. Active (at least 200): At inclusion demographic data and the following samples will be taken; blood, a swab from the back of the nose, stool and urine samples from the nappy. During the RSV season (Oct to March) in first year of life, parents will be contacted weekly to monitor respiratory symptoms. If the infant has an ARTI they will be visited to test (by a nose swab) if the illness is due to RSV. If positive, samples as above will be taken and repeated 7 weeks later. There will be ongoing weekly contact enquiring of further ARTIs. Visits to determine if any respiratory illness is due to RSV continue throughout infantsâ first RSV season. Participants are followed annually by questionnaire.

2,Neoplasms,Malignant neoplasm of breast,Comprehensive Patient Records (CPR) for Cancer Outcomes: A feasibility study Workstream 5: Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs),"Comprehensive Patient Records (CPR) for Cancer Outcomes More people are living with and beyond a cancer diagnosis. The impact of cancer does not stop when treatment is over. There is limited understanding of the long-term effects of cancer and cancer treatment. The purpose of the main CPR study is to securely link information that is de-identified (has all identifiable markers such as name, address and date of birth removed) from electronic GP and community health records, to de-identified data from hospital records. This information will provide a broad picture of what happens to cancer patients across their cancer pathway and treatment. Ethical approval has been granted for the main study. CPR Workstream 5 PROMs (Patient Recorded Outcome Measures) are used for patients to record their own opinions about their health, treatment quality of life and other issues. PROMs are usually in the form of questionnaires. The objective of Workstream 5 is to measure cancer survivorsâ own perceptions of their health, quality of life and financial costs. Workstream 5 will take a smaller sample from the main studyâs population and collect PROMs directly from them. The PROMs survey will be sent to breast, colorectal and ovarian cancer survivors at around 5 years since diagnosis, and a sample of non-cancer controls for comparison. The survey can be completed online or by post. The selected PROMs will measure: finance, health, symptoms, psychological problems, navigating the healthcare system, relationships and barriers to exercise. The PROMs data will then be linked to de-identified data from patients' GP, community health and hospital records using the secure systems for data linkage approved for the main study.

5,Mental and behavioural disorders,Mood [affective] disorders,Physiological Studies to Investigate the Effects of Kisspeptin on Human Brain Processing.,"Psychosexual dysfunction affects 1 in 3 individuals, impairs quality of life and costs the NHS over Â£32 million/year. Current therapies have limited efficacy coupled with multiple side effects. Therefore, there is an unmet need to develop safer and more effective treatments through a deeper understanding of human sexual and emotional brain processing. The limbic system is an area of the brain known to control memories and emotions related to sexual desire and reproductive behaviours. The limbic system interacts with reproductive brain areas and sensory centres such as those related to smell. Kisspeptin is a hormone which is widely expressed in the human limbic system as well as brain areas that control reproduction and sensory inputs. Kisspeptin reduces sexual aversion and negative mood when given to healthy men with specific brain activity changes seen on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In animals, kisspeptin is closely linked to smell, sexual behaviours, mood and memory. This physiological study will investigate whether kisspeptin has similar effects on human brain processing using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants will be recruited into groups of healthy men and women, men and women with low mood and men and women with low sexual desire. Following a screening visit and obtaining informed consent, all participants will attend for two study visits each, during which they will undergo an fMRI scan while receiving either kisspeptin or placebo. During the scan participants will be presented with standardised tasks designed to activate sensory, emotional and reproductive brain pathways so that kisspeptinâs modulation of these pathways can be measured.",â¢ Aged 18 â 70 years â¢ Right handed â¢ Non-smoker â¢ Heterosexual orientation
21,Factors influencing health status and contact with health services,Persons with potential health hazards related to family and personal history and certain conditions influencing health status,Comparing Electrophysiological Brain Measurements of Electrode Function to Speech Perception in Adult Cochlear Implant Users,"For people with insufficient hearing to effectively use hearing aids, cochlear implants can provide great benefit, although they do not restore normal hearing. Cochlear implants stimulate the hearing nerve directly with electrical currents from a set of electrodes surgically implanted into the inner ear (cochlea). Although cochlear implants are a great success, a wide range in speech perception outcomes are observed. The aim of this programme of research is to reduce the variability in performance as well as increasing the levels of speech recognition achieved by all. We propose to achieve this by using a special objective measure to record brain activity in response to sound for cochlear implant users. This technique is called electro-encephalology (EEG) and is used routinely in clinical practice and involves wearing a special hat containing recording contacts to make the measurements. By understanding the relationship between these responses to different sounds and speech understanding it will help us understand how cochlear implant users are listening to different cues in speech and what aspects limit these abilities. These measures will ultimately allow us to observe the brain changes that take place once cochlear implants are switched on and also to guide cochlear implant fitting approaches. This research project explores preliminary measures and it is fulfils one objective in a larger programme of research funded by the Medical Research Council. In this phase of the research we will be looking at the brain responses in cochlear implant users to different types of sounds to understand what they tell us about how the electrodes are working on the cochlear implant. The electrodes sit along the length of the implanted part of the cochlear implant and they are responsible for sending sound information directly to the hearing nerve. These objective brain measurements will be compared to âbehaviouralâ discrimination tasks using the same stimuli so that we can ensure the objective measures are direct measures of a perceptual skill. In a behavioural task the listener responds to the sounds that they hear whereas in an objective task the listener just has to remain awake and does not need to make a response. We will compare both the objective and behavioural results to the speech perception scores of an individual and look at how adjusting the sounds affects perception when listening with electrodes that we consider to be âgoodâ compared to those that we consider to be âbadâ based on our objective and behavioural measures.","- - Adults (18 years or older) with a cochlear implant in one or both ears - No upper age limit - No gender or socio-economic criteria - Speakers of English because the speech test is in English - Post-lingual onset of deafness because we know that pre-lingual onset can result in poor behavioural scores that we believe a different intervention is appropriate for ( training) but this is not the focus of this stage of the research programme - BKB sentence score (routinely tested) in quiet between 20-80% to ensure that they are not 'star'(top) performers and they are not having major device problems - 6 months post implant activation to allow acclimatisation to their device - Implanted 2015 and after to ensure latest version of their cochlear implants - Implanted with either Cochlear or Advanced Bionics devices - Able to travel to the research site at the Cambridge Biomedical Research Campus, Herchel Smith building"
7,Diseases of the eye and adnexa,Disorders of vitreous body and globe,Early Vitrectomy and Intravitreal Antibiotics for post-operative exogenous eNdophthalmitis: A feasibility multicentre randomised controlled trial (EVIAN Study),"What is this study about? To assess the feasibility of doing a trial of the benefit of prompt surgery for a rare but blinding bacterial eye infection known as âendophthalmitisâ that can complicate any invasive eye procedure. Endophthalmitis causes rapid loss of vision and antibiotic injections into the eye (""intravitreal"") may not be sufficient to control the infection. 50% patients need surgery to remove the infected vitreous (vitrectomy) with patients requiring intensive and extended inpatient/outpatient management over a 6-month period. The impact on the well being of patients and their carers, both physically and psychologically, is immense often with severe pain and sight loss, which may or may not recover. How will this study help patients? Earlier surgery, by removing infected vitreous material at diagnosis, rather than after failure to respond to intravitreal antibiotics, may accelerate recovery from the infection. Early vitrectomy may improve vision recovery, patient well-being, reduce NHS and patient costs with less hospital visits,and assist in endeavours to reduce antibiotic usage. What will we do in this study? In order to measure the possible benefit of earlier surgery,we need to conduct a feasibility study of a multicentre randomised controlled trial to discover if the trial we are planning is possible in the reality of urgent care management of these people in current NHS environments.Participants will be randomly allocated to vitrectomy performed at an earlier stage of the condition,or later if needs be in accordance with standard care. What do our patients think about the study? We undertook a focus group with patients who had vitrectomy for endophthalmitis exploring their views and experiences.The consensus was the study was worthwhile.They advised us to approach study patients in an undisturbed environment with nursing support, giving them at least 48 hours to reflect on trial information plan patient advisory group meetings during the study to guide our research.",Inclusion Criteria: General Health: Patient over 18 years of age Patient has capacity to give informed consent Patient not previously been enrolled in this study in regard to fellow eye Diagnosis of postoperative endophthalmitis within 6 weeks of ocular surgery/procedure/injection Patient healthy and willing to undergo vitrectomy surgery Ophthalmic Criteria: Symptomatic visual loss attributable to postoperative endophthalmitis Best corrected Snellen VA worse than 35 ETDRS letters in the study eye Exogenous endophthalmitis
2,Neoplasms,Malignant neoplasm of breast,Technical development of Automated Low Dose Risk Assessment Mammography (ALDRAM) in women attending for annual mammography through a family history clinic,"Breast cancer (BC) is the commonest cause of death in young women. Breast screening in women aged 35-45, at increased risk due to their family history, has been shown to improve survival. However, 80% of women who develop BC do not have a family history. Numerous studies have shown that high mammographic density (MD) is one of the strongest risk factors for BC development. Full field digital mammography (FFDM) can be used to assess MD, however it is not recommended for population BC screening in those < 40 years of age due to the concerns about the use of ionising radiation. Safe and accurate high throughput methods to quantify MD in young women are thus required to improve risk prediction and reduce BC mortality. This study aims to develop a low dose mammogram, with quantification of density using artificial intelligence, to facilitate high throughput risk assessment in young women. 600 women aged 30-45, previously identified as being at increased risk of BC and attending for annual mammography at The Nightingale Centre will be recruited. Participants will undergo FFDM of the right breast as usual, however, following acquisition of the craniocaudal (CC) view, the breast will remain compressed and the mammogram dose reduced by 90% to deliver a LD mammogram. This process will be repeated for the right medio-lateral oblique (MLO) view. The left breast FFDM will proceed as normal. We estimate that each extra exposure will take 1-2 minutes only. We will use deep machine learning methods to define the relationship between standard FFDM views and their low dose counterparts and determine which view (CC vs MLO) provides the best correlation to be taken forward to the next stage of the research.","-Females with moderate to high risk of breast cancer, identified through and attending for annual review and mammography at the family history clinic, Nightingale Centre, Manchester -Current age 30-45 years -Capable of providing informed consent to a patient information sheet written in English"
4,"Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases",Diabetes mellitus,"A low-carbohydrate, low-energy dietary intervention for patients with type 2 diabetes in primary care: a feasibility study","Type 2 diabetes is a lifelong condition in which a personâs blood sugar levels are too high. It affects 1 in 16 people in the UK, and causes almost 15% of adult deaths worldwide. If it isnât controlled, it can lead to blindness, kidney failure, and heart disease. We know that what we eat affects our blood sugar levels, and that changing our diets and losing weight can both help to control diabetes. However, it is not clear what the best advice is to help people achieve this goal. Committed clinicians have shown that, in selected patients, low-carbohydrate, low-energy diets can transform the lives of people with type 2 diabetes, reducing the need for medications, improving quality of life and reducing costs for the NHS. However, we donât know whether this will work for everyone with diabetes, and whether this diet can be managed without intensive help from specialists. We aim to investigate whether it is possible for GPs and practice nurses to support people with type 2 diabetes to change their diet. First to reduce their energy intake to around 800 calories per day for 8 weeks (mostly by cutting out carbohydrates, found in foods like cakes and biscuits but also bread, pasta, rice and potatoes), and second to gradually increase their energy intake while still severely restricting the amount of carbohydrate. We will measure how well the advice is delivered and how successful people are in following the programme over a 3 month period. The findings from this early stage testing will help to refine the programme before we progress to a full-scale study, to investigate whether this diet can improve blood sugar control more effectively than the standard dietary advice for people with diabetes.","- Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the study. - Male or Female, aged 18 years or above. - BMI of > = 30kg/m2 - Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, as defined by an HbA1c > = 48mmol/mol, and who would consider (or prefer) using dietary means rather than increasing medications to improve diabetic control and their general health. - Patients must have undergone diabetic retinopathy screening within the last 12 months."
14,Diseases of the genitourinary system,Renal failure,Strategy for timely intervention of renal support in the ICU,"Critically ill patients who develop acute kidney injury (AKI) have high hospital mortality rates in excess of 50%, despite remarkable improvements in the overall intensive care treatment and the availability of new renal replacement therapy (RRT) methods. RRT is an essential component of modern critical care but the optimal time for starting RRT remains unknown. Furthermore, we do not have a reproducible approach for evaluating patients to decide who needs RRT in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. It is our hypothesis that there is a need for a dynamic risk-stratification tool to identify patients who will or won't need RRT for management of their AKI. In collaboration with a team in San Diego (US), we previously developed a clinical index based on routinely available clinical and laboratory parameters. The index represents the relationship between metabolic and fluid demands placed on the kidneys versus the capacity of the kidneys to handle the demand (i.e. Demand / Capacity index) In this feasibility project, we plan to validate this Demand / Capacity (D/C) index. We propose to demonstrate that sequential assessment of the D/C clinical index in high-risk patients can assist clinicians determining the optimal time for starting, withholding and stopping RRT. For this purpose, we plan to analyse sequential routinely available data of 100 high-risk patients and determine their daily D/C clinical index. After the patient has been discharged from the ICU, we present the D/C index together with the clinical data to the treating clinician and explore whether knowledge of the D/C index would have changed their decision to start, withhold or stop RRT.",â¢ Adult patients > = 18 years â¢ Potential ICU stay > 72 hours
10,Diseases of the respiratory system,Chronic lower respiratory diseases,Can Internet of Things (IoT) technologies enhance self-efficacy and self-management in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)? : an exploratory study,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a long-term lung condition estimated to affect over 1.2 million people in the UK. Death rates from COPD world-wide are increasing rapidly. Common symptoms include breathlessness, cough, fatigue and altered mood. The condition is managed by a combination of medication, exercise and patient education. Patients are offered a structured programme (Pulmonary rehabilitation PR), which focuses on education, exercise and self-management. Medication and PR are effective, if the principles and methods are sustained. However, air quality, temperature, inhaler technique and fear of worsening symptoms affect patient compliance and symptom experience. COPD has great potential to yield benefits from advanced technologies (e.g. mobile phone applications, âsmartâ devices and sensors to detect movement or environmental conditions), collectively known as âInternet of things (IoT) technologiesâ, but their application is currently limited. CityVerve (http://www.cityverve.org.uk/what-is-cityverve/) consists of a number of research projects, acting as âdemonstratorsâ for a range of IoT technologies, exploring the âadded valueâ of combining technologies.

22,Codes for special purposes,Provisional assignment of new diseases of uncertain etiology,COVIDTrach; a UK national cohort study of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheostomy,"When COVID-19 leads to a severe infection in the lung patients need to be placed on a ventilator. Clinical practice before the pandemic was for patients who were expected to be on the ventilator for over 7 days to undergo a tracheostomy, a surgical procedure to put a breathing tube through the neck into the windpipe. It is uncertain whether patients with COVID-19 also benefit from this operation due to the severity of their respiratory illness and high death rate. Furthermore, there is concern that opening the airway through the tracheostomy puts health care professionals performing the procedure at risk of being infected by the corona virus. COVIDTrach is collaborative project by surgeons and intensive care doctors that looks at the outcomes of ventilated COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheostomy and evaluates the use of personal protective equipment and rate of COVID-19 infection amongst operators.

10,"Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium",Delivery,Prostaglandin insert (Propess) versus tran-scervical balloon catheter for out-patient labour induction: A randomised controlled trial of feasibility (PROBIT-F),"Labour is a natural process, but sometimes it needs to be started artificially (Induction of labour). Currently, two methods of induction are used. The aim of this project is to compare how well these methods of labour induction work, which is the safest and least expensive method, and which is more acceptable to and favoured by women. The first method is PGE2 (synthetic prostaglandin), administered as a pessary (Propess) introduced in the vagina that delivers prostaglandin over 24 hours. The drug acts by softening the neck of the womb (cervix). Side effects include commencement of labour pains (contractions), which can sometimes be too frequent/strong and may be harmful to the baby and/or mother. The second less commonly used method is a catheter - a soft rubber tube with an inflatable balloon at the tip. The balloon is placed in the cervix, and softens it by causing the release of natural hormones (prostaglandins) produced by the woman's body. Excessive contractions have not been reported with catheter use. The catheter is an equally effective (but possibly safer and cheaper alternative to Propess) and is currently underutilised; and its use in the outpatient setting deserves further exploration. In this study, we want to find out if the balloon catheter is acceptable to women for labour induction as an out-patient, and furthermore whether women are willing to be allocated at random to Propess or the catheter, and explore their experiences. This data will help us to assess the feasibility and design of a larger future trial.","1.

This study will test a childâs steeping accuracy and body movement as they step onto targets with each leg. We will assess whether these measures are related to other clinical measures of Cerebral Palsy and whether they are reproducible between people and across time. Understanding a measures properties is important if we are to use them in trials and clinical practice. Twenty-five children with Cerebral Palsy will be asked to attend on two occasions. Each session will take up to 90 minutes to complete. Balance while stepping will be measured using a camera that monitors the movement of markers attached to the hips and feet and using a plate that can measure the forces generated while stepping. Children will be asked to step with either foot to targets in front of them or to the side. There will be 15 steps per target and rests will be provided as required. The stepping accuracy and movement of the body will be measured. On session 1 the test will be performed once. On session 2 the test will be repeated twice, once with the person running the test in session 1 and once with another researcher. In addition on session 1 we will measure childrenâs quality of movement while performing everyday tasks. In session 2 we will take measures of some common clinical problems such as leg strength, stiffness and range of motion. We will compare the results of the step test and clinical measures to 25 typically developing children of a similar age. We will see if the measures are reproducible and have any association with the clinical measures of quality of movement and clinical severity.","Children with cerebral palsy who can stand without holding onto equipment but may walk with crutches, sticks or frames- Gross Motor Function Classification levels 1-3.

5,Mental and behavioural disorders,Mood [affective] disorders,Assessment of the asthma specific emotional profile in individuals with asthma and their partners,"Asthma is a disease with a variety of causes, severity and response to treatment. There is research evidence that patients whose asthma is less well controlled suffer higher levels of anxiety and depression compared to healthy people. Research has also shown that individuals with asthma who suffer from psychological distress have worse asthma and poorer self-management. Interventions addressing these psychological disorders have, however, not led to improved asthma control. One possible reason is that increased anxiety and depression arise due to a range of differing emotions. As such, it is important to understand what 'basic emotions' are present in relationship to asthma, such as fear, disgust, sadness or anger and whether these differ from patient to patient. It is also important to understand how they change, through assessing whether there is difference between these emotions and/or their intensity when the asthma is stable and when it flares up. Informal carers of chronically ill patients have also been shown to have increased levels of psychological disorders. Patients and partners can be looked at as one functional unit, so called 'dyad' where one partner's well-being impacts on the other's and vica versa. Therefore it is also important to understand the partners' psychological processes similarly to that of the patients. This study will use questionnaires to identify participantsâ asthma specific emotions and measure their intensities together with levels of anxiety and depression and perceived asthma control. Participants will be asked to complete two sets of questionnaires , one when the asthmatic partner is in stable condition and one when the disease worsens. Patients and partners will be asked to complete the questionnaires independently in their own homes and return them to the researchers by freepost. Returning the completed questionnaires will imply consenting to the study.",Patients with asthma or partners of individuals living with asthma Minimum 18 years of age
2,Neoplasms,"Malignant neoplasms of ill-defined, secondary and unspecified sites",The effect of ketosis on FDG metabolism and PET-CT image quality in cancer,"2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) is a cancer imaging technique, which involves injecting a weakly radioactive form of glucose or 'sugar' known as fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) into the bloodstream. Cancer cells use glucose to generate energy and so accumulate large amounts of FDG, making them visible and readily detectable on PET images. However, normal cells use glucose for energy, making them also visible on PET images. This can sometimes make it difficult to identify where cancer cells are or where they have spread to, especially if some cancers demonstrate very little FDG uptake compared to nearby normal tissues or if cancer cells are located in organs which utilise large amounts of glucose, i.e. the brain. Ketones are natural substances produced by burning fat and represent an evolutionary response to sustain life in response to situations where carbohydrate (glucose) intake/stores are low, e.g. starvation. Ketones acts as fuels for energy but importantly are also able control the choice of fuel used by normal cells, by reducing the amount of glucose being burnt for energy. We believe that, by using a ketone drink to elevate circulating ketone levels in the bloodstream, equivalent to several daysâ worth of fasting (ketosis), it will reduce the number of normal cells utilising glucose and in turn lead to fewer normal cells being visible on the PET images, thereby beneficially influencing image quality. 57 patients with proven cancer already undergoing a FDG PET-CT as part of their routine clinical management, will be invited to return the Kingâs College London & Guyâs and St. Thomasâ (KCL/GSTT) PET Centre, for an additional research FDG PET-CT scan, within 15 working days of their clinical study, which will only differ by the ingestion of a ketone drink prior to scanning.

5,Mental and behavioural disorders,"Organic, including symptomatic, mental disorders",Independent Living Support Functions for the Elderly (IN LIFE),"Independent Living Functions for the Elderly (IN-LIFE) is a 3 year multidisciplinary European project that is funded by Horizon 2020. IN LIFE aims to prolong and support independent living for people with dementia using ICT's. Sheffield is one of six pilot sites across Europe and is also the only UK site. Researchers have been focusing on the potential of technologies in promoting independence for people living with dementia, generally to assist with aspects of safety and security. It is only recently that the potential of technologies as an intervention to support communication, social interaction and leisure activity has been recognised. The Computer Interactive Reminiscence and Conversation Aid (CIRCA) is an innovatively designed interactive software application comprising generic digital media including video, music and photographs (Astell et al 2010).CIRCA is presented on a touch-screen computer that requires no previous knowledge or experience of ICT and is intuitive to use. Previous evaluations of CIRCA have established a number of benefits for both the person living with dementia and those in a supporting role although these evaluations have been small scale and qualitative in nature. IN-LIFE is an opportunity to evaluate the CIRCA computer software with large quantities of people. The intervention consists of 4 phases overall and this application is concerned with phases 2 and 3. Phase 2 will recruit 120 people living with dementia and phase 3 60 people, from Sheffield Memory Services and GP practices. Potential participants will have received a recent diagnosis of dementia (within 12 months) and all those involved will participate from their own homes. Participation will involve a touch screen computer being installed in the persons home enabling interaction for 2 weeks. Measures will be taken before and after the intervention and again a 3 months post intervention.","A recent diagnosis of dementia from Sheffield Memory Services Has the capacity to provide informed written consent Living in their own home Adequate use of the English language Can participate as a dyad (alongside spouse, other family member or friend)"
17,"Congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities",Congenital malformations of the circulatory system,Prophylactic treatment of the ductus arteriosus in preterm infants by acetaminophen,"Treocapa is a Phase II/III European multicenter double-blind randomized trial, concerning prophylactic treatment with acetaminophen (paracetamol) for the first 5 days of life in extremely preterm infants. Premature birth is a significant cause of infant and child morbidity and mortality. Despite technological advances and efforts of child health experts during the last 20 years, the extremely premature infant remains at high risk for death and disability with 15-30% mortality and, in survivors, at least 20-30% risk of morbidity. The ductus arteriosus is open in all newborns at birth. Its constriction and closure are part of the normal process of postnatal adaptation. However, in many extremely preterm infants, the ductus arteriosus does not constrict itself. This defect of early constriction often persists and is a good predictor of subsequent development of patent symptomatic ductus arteriosus (PDA) which is associated with mortality and morbidity. The use of a medication that has an effect on ductus arteriosus with fewer adverse effects, i.e. acetaminophen, could be a safe alternative to current treatments. Thus, early prophylactic treatment of ductus arteriosus by acetaminophen among many neonatologists seems to be an opportunity to reduce mortality and morbidity Phase II is a dose finding phase in order to assess the minimum effective dose regimen (MEDR) of acetaminophen for the closure of PDA for neonates with a gestational age less than 27 weeks Phase III is a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled superiority trial, two arms in a 1:1 ratio. In the intervention arm, 20 mg/kg followed by 7.5 mg/kg quarter in die (QID) will be administered to the 27-28 weeks gestational age group (dosage confirmed through PK/PD data analysis from the previous Finnian study) and the dosage selected after the conclusion of the Phase II will be administered to the 23-26 weeks gestational age group.","Study population âª The study population of the Phase II is constituted of 30 preterm infants of 23-26 weeks of gestational age (10 patients in 23-24 weeks of gestational age, 10 patients in 25 weeks of gestational age and 10 patients in 26 weeks of gestational age). âª The study population of the Phase III, is constituted of 396 preterm infants of 23-26 weeks of gestational age and of 398 preterm infants of 27-28 weeks of gestational age Inclusion criteria âª Birth between 23-26 W for Phase II, between 23-28 W for Phase III âª Post natal age < 12 hours âª Parental or Legal Authority Consent âª Parents with a social security or health insurance (if applicable according to the local regulation)"
13,Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue,Arthrosis,Pilot Randomised Controlled Trial to determine the safety and early efficacy of the Direct Superior Approach in Total Hip Replacement,"Total hip replacement (THR) is routinely performed via a standard posterior or lateral approach. Indeed, 95% of the 90,000 THRs performed in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in 2016 were performed through standard posterior or lateral approaches. These approaches to the hip joint give excellent visualisation of hip anatomy; however, this comes at the cost of a relatively large incision and the sacrifice of some muscle and tendon. These drawbacks led surgeons to develop techniques to perform THR through smaller incisions, termed minimally invasive THR. Minimally invasive THR has been defined by an incision length of 12 cm or less. Proponents of minimally invasive THR believe the potential benefits to be a reduction in soft-tissue trauma, shorter intraoperative time, less perioperative blood loss, less postoperative pain, more rapid rehabilitation, earlier hospital discharge, and improved cosmetic appearance. Critics believe that the disadvantages include reduced operative visualization, a steep learning curve, an increased risk of neurovascular complications, a higher prevalence of dislocation, excessive skin trauma, and compromised implant fixation and positioning. One such minimally invasive approach is the direct superior approach. To investigate whether the direct superior approach is superior than the standard extended posterior approach in total hip replacement, a randomised controlled trial comparing the two is required. We plan to perform a pilot study, with 30 patients in total, with the aim of investigating whether a fully powered trial would be feasible.","â¢ Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the trial â¢ Male or Female, aged 18 to 85 years at recruitment into trial â¢ Diagnosed with hip OA, post-traumatic OA, inflammatory arthropathy, avascular necrosis, or congenital or developmental hip disease, avascular necrosis of the hip â¢ Listed for total hip arthroplasty at the study centre â¢ Female participants of child bearing potential must be willing to ensure that they use effective contraception during the trial â¢ Participant is fit to undergo total hip replacement based on consultant anaesthetist review â¢ In the Investigatorâs opinion, is able and willing to comply with all trial requirements â¢ Willing to allow his or her General Practitioner and consultant, if appropriate, to be notified of participation in the trial"
10,Diseases of the respiratory system,Other diseases of the respiratory system,Role of mathematically arterialised venous blood sampling in the assessment and management of adult subjects with respiratory failure; a prospective observational cohort study to investigate the physiological agreement between arterial sampling (the reference method) and mathematically arterialised venous blood sampling and the impact upon clinical decision-making and patient experience.,"Accurate assessment of gas exchange is essential to manage patients with acute and chronic respiratory failure (too high levels of CO2 in blood). Current guidance is to use arterial blood gas (ABG) sampling. However, clinicians are looking for other approaches as ABG sampling can cause complications including pain (frequent) and injury to the artery. Existing alternative methods include capillary blood gas (CBG) samples via earlobe puncture. In comparison to ABGs, CBGs are easier to obtain and usually less painful. However, they are less accurate. A newer method, v-TAC, is available. V-TAC combines measurements from venous blood (VBG) with oxygen saturation data collected from a pulse oximeter in a process of mathematical arterialisation. VBG sampling is easier and less painful than ABG sampling, but accuracy is limited without mathematical arterialisation. If this method is to be adopted we must ensure that the results obtained are reliable and robust enough to base clinical decisions on, especially for a population of patients with high in-hospital mortality. To date, no studies have evaluated whether calculated arterial values (v-TAC) provide a useful substitute to directly measured values in clinical decision-making. Therefore, we will assess patients with known or suspected chronic respiratory failure. We will obtain simultaneous blood gas samples obtained via arterial, capillary, and venous methods. Any impact on clinical decision making could be assessed by comparing the agreement of ABG, v-TAC, and CBG results against pre-defined clinical treatment thresholds; including the accuracy of detection of a minimally important clinical change in carbon dioxide levels and also the ability of v-TAC to identify clinically relevant treatment thresholds. The primary measure will focus on the comparison of v-TAC to ABG, the existing gold standard.

5,Mental and behavioural disorders,"Neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders","Patientsâ and Practitionersâ views on detecting, diagnosing and managing Anxiety Disorders in Primary Care","Anxiety disorders are a common mental disorder seen in primary care. It has been suggested that there has been a 40% increase in generalised anxiety disorder in the general population between 2007 and 2014. Whilst GP recording of anxiety symptoms has also increased, GP recording of anxiety disorders has decreased between 1998 to 2008. It is not clear why there is a disparity between the increase seen in the general population and estimates based on GP recordings of anxiety disorders, but it may be due to a reluctance by GPs to label patients with an anxiety disorder. In addition, anxiety and depression frequently co-occur, and there may be a tendency by GPs to prioritise recording depression over anxiety, potentially as a result of the 2014 Quality and Outcomeâs Framework. However, little is known about how GPs view the labelling and recording of anxiety, and their experience of discussing symptoms of anxiety or anxiety disorders with patients. Moreover, research suggests that patients may feel reluctant to seek help because they think that GPs may see symptoms as âtrivial, or there is a lack of encouragement by GPs to disclose psychological problems. Yet to date, no study in the UK has asked patients specifically about their views and experiences of seeking help for anxiety. The aim of this study is to interview patients, GPs, and clinicians who provide therapy to those with anxiety disorders, to understand how they view and experience the identification, diagnosis and management of anxiety disorders. Around 15 GPs, 20 patients, and 15 therapists will be interviewed. The interviews will be audio-recorded, fully transcribed and analysed so that the views practitioners and patients hold towards specific issues can be summarised and highlighted. By understanding more about these issues, we aim to improve patient care and outcomes for this group.","The study will entail conducting interviews with three groups: GPs, Patients and IAPT therapists.

Pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure and protein in urine) affects 2-7% of pregnant women and is potentially life-threatening to mother and baby. Both are also more likely to develop heart disease later in life. Outside pregnancy, high salt intake causes an increase in blood pressure. However our initial studies have shown that healthy women, early in pregnancy, have lowered blood pressure in response to salt. This agrees with earlier clinical studies, which indicated that the reduction of salt intake did not improve development of pre-eclampsia. My research, therefore aims to look at salt intake, in both healthy pregnancies and in women who develop pre-eclampsia. I will also study whether salt-sensing is altered, leading to a loss of salt from the body, resulting in high blood pressure and pre-eclampsia. We hope to use the results from this research to see if higher intakes of salt in pregnancy can reduce the chances of developing pre-eclampsia. We hope to find out more on how blood vessels work and whether extra salt can improve the chances of a healthy pregnancy and normal development of the placenta. We will also see if salt reduces the chances of women developing pre-eclampsia and, if it does, to understand how it does so. If we know more about these dietary-related changes, we may be able to advise at-risk women to take salt supplements to reduce their chances of developing pre-eclampsia, which may help prevent problems such as heart disease when the mother and baby are older","Pregnant women at term: â¢ Pregnant women, aged between 18 years of age and 45 years of age inclusive, who are either normotensive (for control tissue), or with GH, PE, with or without IUGR or IUGR alone or PTB.

These abnormalities in arterial stiffness could be driven by the risk factors for those conditions (e.g. cigarette smoke, obesity). Neuromuscular disease also causes hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia, without these risk factors. Thus the opportunity exists to determine whether hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia alone cause arterial stiffness. We hypothesized that arterial stiffness is increased in motor neurone disease patients with hypoxaemia including respiratory failure compared to those without and that non invasive ventilation has an effect on arterial stiffness in these patients. The study aims to compare the arterial stiffness in motor neuron disease patients with hypoxaemia and/or hypercapnia with those without.

In children below 20kg of weight, enalapril is widely used offÂ¬label on the basis of a few clinical studies. Its safety and efficacy is well understood, especially in the older population and is regarded as gold standard therapy in heart failure. Enalapril is currently available only in the form of tablets in the European Union. Although oral liquids from crushed tablets are commonly used for infants and young children, they are less portable than solids. Also, due to problems when the drug is dissolved, solid oral paediatric dosage forms are needed. Within the LENA project, the new dosage form of so called orodispersible minitablets (ODMTs) will be used as a vehicle for enalapril. ODMTs are small sized tablets (2mm in diameter) which immediately disintegrate in the mouth. Hence, accidental particle inhalation or in the worst case aspiration pneumonia can be prevented. This study will involve children from birth up to 6 years of age, all of whom have heart failure due to congenital heart disease. The children will be seen and treated at the hospital where their routine clinical care already takes place.

These impairments have been shown to have detrimental effects on childrenâs social development and mental health, and are associated with rejection and bullying by peers, school exclusion and mental health problems.

6,Diseases of the nervous system,Other disorders of the nervous system,Deep Learning for Identification of Abnormalities on Head MRI,"Unexpected abnormalities with potential clinical relevance (incidental findings) occur in 2.7% of head MRI studies. There is a wide variation in how incidental findings (IFs) discovered in âhealthy volunteersâ are managed. Routine reporting of âhealthy volunteersâ by a radiologist is a challenging logistic and financial burden and in a survey of UK institutions performing research imaging, just 14% of institutions had this as policy. It would be valuable to devise automated strategies to ensure that IFs could be reliably and accurately identified which potentially would remove 90% of scans requiring routine radiological review, thereby increasing the feasibility of implementing a routine reporting strategy. Deep learning is a new technique in computer science that automatically learns hierarchies of relevant features directly from the raw inputs (e.g. MRI) using multilayered neural networks. Previous studies have demonstrated the potential of deep learning methods in the basic interpretation of neuroradiological studies including MRI scans. We will train a deep learning algorithm on a large database of head MRI studies to recognise studies with abnormalities. The Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences (King's College London) has acquired and stored more than 20,000 head MRI studies which are available for research purposes.

In response to research showing that the care needs of adolescents and young adults with cancer are poorly met, there has been a rapid expansion in the availability of dedicated services for teenagers and young adults (TYA; aged 15 to 24 years at diagnosis) in the United Kingdom. However, no age-specific care services are available for young adult cancer patients aged 25 to 39 years at cancer diagnosis, while this patient group also faces age-specific issues that can negatively impact health-related quality of life. The current patient care for young adults with cancer may be compromised by the lack of insight into the young adult cancer patient journey and probably inadequate care infrastructure (e.g. resource availability, lack of expertise). What are our aims? To be able to develop age-specific supportive care services for young adults with cancer, this study aims to provide insight into the young adult cancer care experience, the (unmet) supportive care needs, impact of cancer on young adultsâ lives, and preferences for and expectations of age-specific cancer care. How will we do this? This study has a mixed method design. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups will be conducted with young adult cancer patients, their health care professionals and informal caregivers about the preferences and expectations of age-specific care. A survey will be administered to all alive young adult cancer patients diagnosed with cancer aged 25-39 years in the Royal Marsden Hospital in the past five years. The survey measures care experiences, supportive care needs, health-related quality of life, psychological distress, impact of cancer, illness cognitions and self-management. What can we learn?

15,"Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium",Complications of labour and delivery,Prediction of Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes Following Induction of Labour,"Induction of labour (IOL) is one of the most common obstetric procedures and is carried out in 20-30% of pregnancies. More than a third of women having IOL will need either an instrumental delivery or a caesarean section. Currently, the Bishop score, based on findings of vaginal examination, is the most commonly used clinical assessment prior to IOL. Unfortunately, it is subjective and unreliable and its utility at predicting successful vaginal delivery is limited. A model that could accurately predict which women will have a successful induction of labour would be of significant benefit in counselling women prior to induction. We propose to develop a model that will accurately predict the time from induction to delivery and the risk of caesarean section using a combination of maternal and fetal factors measured at a pre-induction clinic. The biochemical factors measured will include fetal fibronectin and placental alpha-macroglobulin-1, both markers of preterm delivery that have not been robustly studied in an induction of labour context. We will also systematically measure throughout labour three recently described ultrasound parameters (angle of progression, head-perineum distance, sonographic cervical dilatation) in women undergoing induction in order to assess their utility in predicting operative delivery.",1.

When this occurs a peripheral neuropathy can occur when the nerves carrying sensory information are affected. People with diabetic peripheral neuropathy have a high risk of foot ulceration and amputation which affects function and associated with high NHS and social care costs. People with diabetes can also have reduced movement at joints caused by increased stiffness in connective tissue. Reductions in ankle and big toe movement leads to increases in the pressure over the sole on the front part of the foot (the forefoot) when walking; this is a risk factor for ulceration. The study will to assess whether ankle and big toe joint mobilisations and home program of stretches in people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy improves joint range of motion and reduces forefoot peak pressures. Fifty eight people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy and a moderate risk of plantar ulceration will be recruited from a local podiatry clinic. They will be randomly assigned to an intervention (29 people) or control group (29 people). We will control for between-group differences in age using a minimization process. The intervention will consist of a 6 week program of ankle and big toe joint mobilisation by a physiotherapist and home stretches. The control group will consist of usual care including podiatry interventions. Outcome measures will be taken at baseline, post intervention and at 3 month follow up by an assessor who does not know the group allocation. Primary outcome will be ankle range while walking with secondary outcomes including big toe joint range, forefoot pressure while walking and balance. Changes over time between the groups will be compared statistically and the relationship between ankle range of motion and peak plantar pressure will be analysed using linear regression.","a)Diagnosis of type I or II diabetes with a moderate risk of foot ulceration as defined by i.Detection in less than < 8/10 sites on the plantar aspect of the foot using a 10 g monofilament ii.Foot deformity defined and graded using a foot deformity score previously developed for people with diabetes b)Peripheral Neuropathy- This is defined according to NICE CG19 guidelines.

2,Neoplasms,Malignant neoplasms of female genital organs,Muscle wAsting in Major Abdominal Surgery (MAMAS II Study),"Following major surgery, the functional capacity of patients is affected. This is due to muscle wasting and weakness. Recovery after surgery can take more than a year especially in frail and elderly patients. We have previously carried out a study (MAMAS study), which showed patients that undergo elective major abdominal surgery for liver/pancreas/gallbladder/bile ducts and women reproductive tract cancer lose 10 % of their muscle size and undergo a similar decrease in muscle strength within a week of surgery. However more frequent measure of muscle size and strength post-surgery is needed to find out the lowest point of muscle loss and weakness and when the recovery starts. In this study we will enrol 24 patients having elective major abdominal surgery for liver/pancreas/gallbladder/bile ducts and women reproductive tract cancer. We will measure breathing and thigh muscle size using ultrasound scan and carry out hand grip strength and sniff test (to assess breathing muscle strength) before the surgery, day 1 post-surgery, and thereafter on alternate days until hospital discharge and at 6 weeks after the discharge. In addition, we will also carry out simple physical function tests and questionnaires before and 6 weeks after surgery. Small amount (~45 mg) of abdominal muscle biopsy tissue will be collected during the surgery (optional) and bloods sample at four time points (pre-op, day 1 post-surgery, day 7 post-surgery/hospital discharge and 6 weeks after discharge) during the study participation. The outcome of this study will allow to design future interventional studies to reduce the muscle loss and weakness post-surgery. This could lead to improve recovery rate following major abdominal surgery, shorter stay in hospital and fewer post-operative complications and readmission.",1. Age > = 18 years 2.

1,Certain infectious and parasitic diseases,Other bacterial diseases,External pilot study to inform the design and conduct of the Fluids in Shock (FiSh) Trial,"Children are now much more likely to survive a severe infection than ever before. This progress comes from a whole package of treatments including antibiotics, multiple rapid doses (boluses) of fluid (e.g. saline solution) into a childâs veins (âfluid bolus therapyâ) and support for breathing and heart function. We hope to improve the outcome of children with severe infection by refining one part of this package: by exploring what is the best amount of fluid to give in the earliest stages of treatment. We are designing a clinical trial (called Fluids in Shock â FiSh) to find out whether giving less fluid per bolus to children with symptoms of a severe infection (septic shock) is better than giving a higher amount of fluid, as currently recommended. We are conducting a pilot trial, a smaller version of the trial we would like to run. We will recruit 108 children admitted with septic shock to emergency departments in 14 NHS hospitals over nine months. Patients will be randomly allocated to receive either fluid boluses of 10 ml/kg (intervention) or 20 ml/kg (usual care) every 15 minutes for up to four hours. We would also like to ask parents/legal representatives who do and do not give consent to the study their views on the consenting process. Questionnaires (100-150) and telephone interviews (15-25) will be used to explore the parents/legal representativesâ acceptability of the study, including the approach to recruitment, consenting procedures and participant information materials. We will also hold three focus groups with the hospital research teams to explore their experiences of screening, recruiting, randomising and consenting parents/legal representatives to the pilot trial. By doing this study, we hope to find out whether the trial is possible and, if so, how it should be done.","Pilot RCT â¢ Age greater than or equal to 37 weeks (corrected gestational age) and less than 16 years â¢ Clinical suspicion of infection â¢ Clinical signs of shock after receipt of 20 ml/kg of bolus fluid â¢ Recruitment and randomisation to take place while child is in an acute assessment area (e.g. ED, paediatric assessment unit (PAU)) Parent/Legal representative questionnaires and interviews â¢ Parents/Legal representatives who do and do not consent to the pilot RCT Site research staff focus groups and interviews â¢ Site research staff who are involved in screening, recruiting, randomising and consenting parents/legal representatives during the pilot RCT"
14,Diseases of the genitourinary system,Renal failure,What factors explain the association between socioeconomic deprivation and a reduced likelihood of living-donor kidney transplantation? A questionnaire based case-control study.,"A living-donor kidney transplant (LDKT) describes a kidney transplant in which a kidney is donated by a living friend or family member and transplanted into someone with kidney failure. A LDKT is the best treatment for most people with kidney failure. Socioeconomically deprived people in the UK are more likely to develop kidney failure, but less likely to receive a LDKT. This study aims to investigate whether socioeconomic position is related to a kidney patientâs i) transplant knowledge and beliefs, ii) level of involvement in managing their own healthcare, and iii) support and offers of donation from friends and family. The study will determine whether these potentially modifiable factors explain why more deprived patients are less likely to receive a LDKT, and identify targets for intervention.",We aim to collect responses from approximately 930 living-donor kidney transplant (LDKT) recipients (cases) and 930 deceased-donor kidney transplant (DDKT) recipients (controls) from all adults (age> 18) transplanted at the ten UK study sites between 1/4/2013 and 31/3/17.

Participants infected with HCV, without liver cirrhosis (when normal liver tissue is damaged and replaced by scar tissue), received 8 weeks of the combination drug. The treatment was shown to be safe and effective, curing almost 99% of people infected with HCV without cirrhosis regardless of their HCV strain (genotype). There was no need for ribavirin, which is an antiviral drug with serious side effects that is given in combination with other drugs used to treat HCV. Glecaprevir (300mg)/pibrentasvir (120mg) had no specific toxicity or side effects of treatment. Due to this factor, and because no ribavirin is required, there is no need for monitoring of full blood count or liver function. The combination can be safely administered without regular monitoring of blood levels; as is the standard of care treatment for drugs used to treat HCV currently. The aim of this study is to determine if on-treatment monitoring can be simplified for chronic HCV patients without cirrhosis receiving glecaprevir (300mg)/pibrentasvir (120mg) for 8 weeks. One post treatment visit will be conducted 12 weeks after the final dose of study medication to evaluate the proportion of patients with undetectable HCV RNA at this timepoint (SVR12).","1) Have voluntarily signed the informed consent form. 2) 18 years of age or older. 3) Chronic HCV infection as defined by anti-HCV antibody or HCV RNA detection for greater than 6 months. 4) HCV RNA plasma > = 10,000 IU/ml at screening. 5) HCV genotype 1-6. 6) HCV treatment naÃ¯ve (no prior treatment with an approved or investigation anti-HCV medication). 7) Stage F0-3, based on: hepatic elastography < 12.5 kPa on FibroscanÂ® or APRI < 1.0. 8) If co-infection with HIV is documented, the subject must meet the following criteria: - ART naÃ¯ve with CD4 T cell count > 500 cells/mm3; OR - On a stable ART regimen for > 8 weeks prior to screening visit, with CD4 T cell count > 200 cells/mm3 and a plasma HIV RNA level below the limit of detection. 9) Negative pregnancy test at screening and baseline (females of childbearing potential only). 10) All fertile females must be using effective contraception during treatment and during the 30 days after treatment end."

To prevent this, mechanically-ventilated patients in the ICU are frequently given stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) in the form of one of two types of medicine: proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or histamine-2 receptor blockers (H2RBs). Despite SUP being administered to millions of ICU patients worldwide, it is unclear where PPIs or H2RBs are preferable and current usage is dependent on clinician preference or unit policy rather than empirical evidence. The PEPTIC study will compare the two approaches to SUP treatment regimens to determine which leads to the best outcomes for patients. The study is being conducted in New Zealand, Australia, Ireland and England. Data will be collected on patients admitted to ICUs requiring mechanical ventilation where SUP is considered clinically appropriate. Data required for the study is already routinely recorded in ICUs â in England, this will be collected through the ICNARC Case Mix Programme (CMP).",- Aged 18 years and above - Admitted to a participating ICU - Invasively mechanically ventilated within the first 24 hours of a ICU admission

The trial population are those who have had symptoms for at least six weeks despite conservative management such as physiotherapy and pain relief. A total of 252 participants will be recruited, and randomised to receive one of two types of operation. One type of operation is posterior cervical foraminotomy (PCF), which involves operating through the back of the neck. The other type of operation is anterior cervical discectomy (ACD), which involves operating through the front of the neck. Both of these operations are currently standard treatments for this condition. Potential participants will be identified in neurological centres in the UK following referral from their GP, they will be given a Patient Information Sheet and then informed consent will be taken if they would like to take part. Participants will then be registered to the study, and have assessments performed. Participants will complete questionnaires, then be randomised to a treatment arm on the day of their operation.

5,Mental and behavioural disorders,Unspecified mental disorder,"The Involvement of Family, Friends and Carers in Inpatient Mental Health Care: What Do Patients Want? Qualitative Interviews with Patients, Carers and Clinicians.","Studies have found that people using mental health services are more likely to stick to their treatment plans and have better outcomes when their supportive friends and family members (âcarersâ) are involved in their care. Most mental health guidelines and policies suggest that staff members should involve carers in patientsâ treatment. Despite this, carers frequently report feeling excluded from patientsâ care and from giving or receiving information about the patient. This is particularly a problem in hospital settings, when someone is admitted to an inpatient ward following a mental health crisis. The difficulties that carers can face are well documented in published research. There are also lots of studies discussing staff membersâ and researchersâ opinions about how best to involve carers. However, the thoughts and feelings of patients themselves have not really been explored in detail. As a result, there is almost nothing in the research literature which helps clinicians understand how patients want involvement to take place or which things might be important for them when making their decisions. In this study, qualitative interviews will be conducted with twenty patients, twenty carers and ten clinicians to better understand the needs of patients in inpatient settings. All participants will need to have current or recent (within the past five years) experience of being in inpatient settings. Each interview is expected to last 45-120 minutes. The interviews will be analysed using thematic analysis. The findings will be written up in a journal article, as well as being shared on social media. This study is being conducted as part of an NIHR-funded Doctoral Research Fellowship (DRF-2015-08-071) titled, âThe involvement of family and friends in inpatient mental health care: what do patients want?â.","Patients 1.

2,Neoplasms,Malignant neoplasms of digestive organs,Primary and Secondary Screening in individuals with Inherited Pancreatic Disease syndromes for Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and complications of other pancreatic diseases.,"Pancreatic cancer has one of the worst overall survival of malignancy (five year survival under 10%). The main reason for this is late detection. Symptoms are non- specific and screening of asymptomatic individuals is impractical as no current screening system has adequate specificity to avoid false positives exceeding true positives, treatment for pancreatic cancer involves surgical resection of the organ with very high associated morbidity and even mortality. In order to develop and validate improved screening modalities these need to be applied to high risk individuals. Current guidelines only allow research screening in individuals with an autosomal dominant predisposition for pancreatic cancer. The European Registry for heredity pancreatitis and familial pancreatic cancer (EUROPAC) was established in 1996 in order to identify individuals at high risk of pancreatic cancer. We wish to continue recruitment to this registry and to continue to pilot secondary screening for pancreatic cancer in the individuals registered. The registry has also proved an invaluable resource in order to study pancreatic diseases in general: diabetes, acute and chronic pancreatitis as well as cancer. We also wish to continue this analysis. The screening we propose to carry out will be based on established methods of pancreatic imaging including Endoluminal Ultrasound, Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging. This will be supplemented by use of biomarkers which will at first be purely experimental but following validation will be used to phase subsequent screening. Epidemiological and demographic data as well as clinical reports will be used to stratify cancer risk and to monitor disease progression: acute pancreatitis can progress to chronic pancreatitis with endocrine and exocrine failure; diabetes mellitus can be both an early sign of pancreatic cancer and also a risk factor.","Inclusion Criteria for Registry: Cancer families: Two first degree relatives with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. A family with three or more relatives with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

Pancreatitis families: Families with two or more relatives with idiopathic pancreatitis. Families with at least one case of pancreatitis and a confirmed causative mutation in the PRSS1 gene. Cyst surveillance: Individuals already enrolled on surveillance due to identification of a pancreatic cystic lesion NOD individuals: Individuals over the age of 40 with diabetes mellitus diagnosed in the last 6 months Disease control Individuals with: diagnosed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; acute or chronic pancreatitis of any aetiology; and individuals with long term (over two years) type 2 or 3c diabetes mellitus Inclusion Criteria for Screening: Individuals over 40 years of age from an established pancreatic cancer family where the family is consistent with predisposition with high penetrant autosomal dominant inheritance (for example, at least two first degree relatives with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where no non-penetrant carriers have to be assumed over the age of 75). Individuals with Peutz-Jeghers syndromes, or individuals with affected relatives under the age of 50 will be considered for inclusion below the age of 40. Unaffected members of a family with an associated cancer syndrome and at least one case of pancreatic cancer, who are over 40 years of age and who have been shown to carry the relevant genetic alteration. Any member of a Hereditary Pancreatitis (HP) family (autosomal dominant predisposition for pancreatitis) who have been confirmed to carry a causative PRSS1 mutation or (where no causative mutation is known) have symptoms of pancreatitis. Individuals incidentally found to have cystic lesions or other clinical features that indicate an increased risk of pancreatic cancer may also be included.

It is a high grade, aggressive B-cell lymphoma, and without treatment, survival is in the order of months. There are a number of standard treatments that are currently used in treating DLBCL, depending on the stage of the disease. Though the cancer often responds to these current treatments, there are instances where the cancer does not respond or where it returns. There is, therefore, a need to find alternative treatments that are more effective, leading to lasting responses. PLACARD study will investigate whether CXD101, a type of drug that blocks substances (enzymes) in the body called histone deacetylases and pembrolizumab, a type of immunotherapy designed to 're-awaken' the immune system, will improve response to treatment. There are 2 distinct stages to the study. The first stage of the study, called the safety run in stage, aims to find the highest tolerated dose of CXD101 which be given with the pembrolizumab. Up to 12 adult (aged > = 18 years) patients (3 patient cohort) with DLBCL, whose disease has either come back or not responded after 2 rounds of treatment will be recruited at this stage and given CXD101 and pembrolizumab. If there are no serious side effects, the second stage of the study, called the expansion stage, will recruit a further 33 patients. Patients will be seen regularly during treatment and then every 3 months until one year after treatment and then annually thereafter until the last patient entering the study completes their 1 year follow up.

The optical coherence tomography (OCT) scanner is a method of achieving this. It is similar to an ultrasound but uses light instead of sound and does not make contact with the tissue (in this case eye) being scanned. It is like having an eye scan at the airport.

Stage-1 aims to collect a range of views about injured adultsâ psychological needs and care to inform later development of a joint patient/practitioner workshop using participatory theatre to inspire changes in practice. This topic is important, we know that every year 5.8 million UK adults attend A&E following an accidental injury, 700,000 are admitted. More than 30% develop psychological problems (e.g. post-traumatic stress disorder) within 12 months. These delay and limit the extent of recovery and increase costs. Research emphasises the need to look after injured peoplesâ psychological wellbeing and provides evidence about the best ways to do it. However âThe Impact of Injuries studyâ showed that NHS injured adultsâ psychological care is generally poor. This is a good example of the limitations of research in improving practice and need for new ways to impart knowledge to effect change. Research suggests NHS practitioners need different sources of evidence and types of knowledge to provide effective care and manage the NHSâs complex demandsÍ¾ furthermore evidence suggests practitionerâs knowledge is largely learned through social not formal means. This explains why scientific evidence sometimes fails to make a difference in practice. So this study will combine different forms of knowledge, then represent it in a living performance to try and overcome these barriers. The project lasts for 3 years, earlier stages will help inform later ones, so we are currently applying for Stage-1 ethical approval only. Stage-1, lasting 1 year, aims to capture NHS patient, practitioner and research perspectives on injured adults psychological needs and care (and illustrative patient stories) using semi-structured interviews and focus groups.

All problems become more prominent as the disease progresses. The analysis of language change has led to particularly revealing insights, which may aid in the prediction of onset and prognosis of AD. Previous studies have found that analysing spoken language using a range of computational methods called Natural Language Processing (NLP) can distinguish individuals with AD from those without, very early on in the disease. Furthermore, analysis of writing can reveal changes in language apparent before other symptoms appear. We wish to build on this work, by investigating spoken discourse in patients recently diagnosed with probable AD, compared to cognitively intact ageing, over one-year. The aim is to identify components of speech, or âlinguistic factorsâ, which are sensitive to brain changes in AD. We will investigate novel techniques for collecting speech samples, in order to improve current methods used clinically and in research. Furthermore, we will investigate written language over one year, to analyse which linguistic factors are sensitive to change, and look at MRI scans to see where changes in the brain may relate to changes in language.","For patient cohort: 1.

1,Certain infectious and parasitic diseases,Other bacterial diseases,A phase III randomised controlled trial of continuous beta-lactam infusion compared with intermittent beta-lactam dosing in critically ill patients.,"Sepsis is the most common cause of death in critically ill patients, with a quarter of those developing severe sepsis during their hospitalisation. Even though the outcomes of patients with severe sepsis have improved, the number of patients with sepsis has increased. Currently there is no effective treatment for severe sepsis other than prompt administration of fluids, antibiotics and supportive care. These hospital acquired infections are recognised as an increasing public health problem causing more than a million deaths worldwide. It is already well established that administration of beta-lactam antibiotics is beneficial to patients with severe sepsis as these antibiotics treat the most common Gram +ve/-ve bacterial causes of infection. In animal and in vitro models it has been shown that continuous infusion of these antibiotics is superior to intermittent infusion, however human trials have been under-powered to provide significant evidence of this. This trial is aiming to determine whether giving a patient a continuous infusion of a beta lactam compared to an intermittent beta lactam infusion would affect patient outcomes and the vital status of patients at hospital discharge. The George Institute for Global Health is taking a stepwise program of research which to date has included a feasibility pilot randomised controlled trial (BLING I) and a phase IIb trial (BLING II), comparing continuous administration of beta-lactam antibiotics in ICU patients. BLING I had a sample size of 60 patients, BLING II had a sample size of 432 patients and looked at ICU free days at day 28. BLING III will be a definitive global trial to provide necessary evidence on whether there is a survival and economic benefit associated with continuous beta-lactam infusion in sepsis patients.",Eligible patients will be: 1. Those with a documented site of infection or strong suspicion of infection 2. Those that the treating physician believes will require treatment that extends beyond the next calendar day 3. Those that the treating physician has chosen to treat with piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem for this episode of infection 4. Those that the treating physician is uncertain whether the administration of a continuous or intermittent infusion would be better for the patient 5.

These symptoms are associated with lower quality of life and higher care costsÍ¾ increasing the cost of care for a person with dementia by around Â£30000 a year compared to a person with dementia without agitation symptoms. Our study team has developed a conceptual framework in which agitation experienced by people with dementia is strongly linked to lower quality of life and agitation is conceptualized as arising from, at least in part, a range of possible unmet needs. This includes external factors like staff being available, receptive, aware and skilled in providing accessible activities and physical and emotional comfort (including sensory) and the environment, such as other agitated residents. In severe dementia, unmet need may may manifest in more subtle or hidden agitation behaviours compared to walking without purpose or aggression, and require different skills by staff to recognise and attend to. Through mixed methods, we aim to test the feasibility, acceptability, and practicality of the manual. As part of this study, we will interview staff in care homes about the content, mode of intervention (manual), enablers and barriers to the intervention. We will interview family carers about the manual. We will use these for manual development modifying it in response to feedback. In addition, we will test the feasibility of primary and secondary outcomes for a definitive trial.","Care home inclusion criteria: Homes registered with CQC as a nursing home or care homes with nursing accessible from UCL (Maple House) within 60 minutes using public transport with a dementia-specific floor, unit, or community with a member of senior staff designated as a dementia lead or Champion.

5,Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue,Inflammatory polyarthropathies,ASSESSment of modified composite disease measures in recently diagnosed psoriatic arthritis,"Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory arthritis occurring in up to 30% of patients with skin psoriasis. Patients can develop swelling in joints, tendons, spine, skin, nails and eyes causing stiffness, pain and fatigue. Left untreated the inflammation results in damage causing further pain and restricted movement. Cohort studies have demonstrated progression of joint destruction, deteriorating functional status and a negative impact quality of life and ability to work. Historically the primary outcome measure in psoriatic arthritis trials have been measures that focus solely on the articular manifestations of disease. It is now recognised that this approach is insufficient to truly capture the totality of disease burden. In response there has been an international effort to devise a composite measure that captures all domains of disease. Several candidate measures have now been developed however these existing measures lacked patient involvement during their development (thereby potentially not fully capturing domains of disease important to patients) and remain time consuming to undertake. This study forms part of a National Institute for Health Research funded study to investigate the effect of enhanced surveillance for the early detection of arthritis amongst patients with psoriasis. A major theme of this programme is to improve outcome measurement in psoriatic arthritis through the incorporation of the patient perspective in existing composite measures and development of shortened versions for use in routine clinical practice. In order to modify the existing composite measures a staged qualitative study is already underway which will report a ranked list of outcomes important to patients mapped on to existing measures. In addition shorter versions of the measures will be developed from existing datasets. The purpose of this study is to compare the modified and shortened composite measures with the original versions and assess their validity (reliability, responsiveness and determining the minimally important difference).",Age 16 and over Fulfil ClASsification of Psoriatic ARthritis (CASPAR) diagnostic criteria for PsA Disease duration < 2 years (based on diagnosis not symptom onset)
9,Diseases of the circulatory system,Pulmonary heart disease and diseases of pulmonary circulation,STOPping Anticoagulation for isolated or incidental subsegmental Pulmonary Embolism,"Pulmonary embolisms (PE) occur when blood clots cause a blockage of the blood supply to the lungs. A small PE located in the subsegmental pulmonary vasculature is identified as a subsegmental PE (SSPE). Anticoagulants are used to treat SSPE and work by preventing new clots from forming whilst the bodyâs own mechanisms break down the clots, however they can also increase the risk of major and potentially life threatening bleeding. More recent observational data of routine care for SSPE showed very high complication rates of anticoagulation but in patients where treatment was withheld, this proved to be a safe strategy in terms of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE). Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) scans are now able to detect SSPE, however there are concerns that there is an over-diagnosis due to the incorrect interpretation of small artefacts. 1466 patients from approximately 50 sites will be recruited, these sites will consist of hospitals across the UK. Patients 18 and over with isolated SSPE, confirmed by either CTPA or CT thorax with IV contrast, will be eligible for the trial. Patients will be randomised to either receive standard anticoagulation for at least 3 months (control) or no anticoagulation for at least 3 months (intervention). The participant will receive telephone follow up calls at 4, 12 and 24 weeks following the end of their treatment, and additional data will also be taken from their medical records at these time points. The participant isnât required to be contacted for the 52 week follow up as the data will be extracted from the NHS Digital collection of Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). In total participation in the study will last 12 months.

PROs can include symptoms, function, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and perceptions of treatment.

11,Diseases of the digestive system,Diseases of liver,Detection and Assessment of Liver Fibrosis Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"Chronic liver disease is listed among the top 5 causes of premature death in the UK. The health issues associated with chronic liver disease are mostly due to scar tissue in the liver, known as liver fibrosis. When liver fibrosis is present, the tissue becomes stiffer, so that the liver feels more firm than normal. Fibrosis is graded according to the degree of stiffness, i.e. by assessing how much normal liver tissue has been replaced by scar tissue. While manual palpation is used to assess the stiffness of tissue in other parts of the body (e.g. breast), this is often impossible in liver due to itâs location underneath the rib cage. Until recently the only option to assess the liver for fibrosis was a liver biopsy, which is a procedure in which a small needle is inserted into the liver to collect a tissue sample. This sample is investigated under a microscope. Biopsy is so far the most reliable procedure, although it is invasive, painful and in rare cases leads to major bleeding. Our study aims to detect and assess the different stages of liver fibrosis, by âfeelingâ the stiffness of the liver, using a non-invasive technology, a new type of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) which will be combined with Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE). MRE is an emerging technique in clinical practice that uses low frequency sound waves to assess the tissueâs biomechanical properties, such as stiffness. The images can be captured using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). If proven useful, the new MRI scan will enable doctors to test whether a liver is scarred and if so how much scar tissue is present. This would allow doctors in the near future to choose the most appropriate therapy without having to perform an invasive liver biopsy.","Subjects will be recruited from one of the following 3 groups: - Adult healthy volunteers: 18 years of age or older, recruited via KCL advertisement. - Chronic liver disease patients aged 18 years or older scheduled for liver biopsy regardless of the presence of HCC. Patients will be selected by clinical partner (KCH); - Patients aged 18 years or older with advanced HCC who are due to commence systemic therapy with sorafenib (KCH). Principal inclusion criteria: - The capacity to understand the patient information sheet and the ability to provide written informed consent; - Routine clinical liver biopsy scheduled and/or within 6 months of study visit (preferably within 2 months) applicable for patients with chronic liver disease). - For patients in the HCC/sorafenib group, biopsy material is more rare (as HCC is diagnosed mainly using imaging studies) and we will allow specimens up to 2 years old to fullfil inclusion criteria."

Current first line treatments are inadequate and are associated with high rates of early relapse. Despite the recent introduction of novel agents for patients with relapsed disease prognosis is again very poor. There are currently no targeted treatments although monoclonal antibodies directed against Tfh surface markers including PD1 are available (Ansell et al, 2014) and have been trialled in other conditions. Similarly therapeutic anti-ICOS antibodies (MedImmune, MEDI-570) have been trialled in autoimmune conditions and a phase 1/2 trial for PTCL is about to start recruitment in Canada (Clinical Trials Identifier: NCT02520791). Over the next few years, therefore, treatment for PTCL is anticipated to change radically. A PTCL Biobank will be a valuable resource to expedite the development of diagnostic tests, based on the new genetics of these diseases and biobank samples will also be used to investigate biomarkers for response to specific therapies and the prediction of relapse.","Newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory PTCL patients including: Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma ALK+ anaplastic large-cell lymphoma ALK- anaplastic large-cell lymphoma PTCL-NOS Male or Females, aged 18 years or above.

The aim of this intervention is to enable people with cancer to experience a rapid reduction in stress and improved feelings of wellbeing and inner peace. In addition to being able to enter and immerse themselves in high quality peaceful, calm environments, people with cancer will be able to access a series of guided exercises to help them cultivate and experience self-compassion, which is known to be associated with several therapeutic effects. This is important because many people with cancer experience poor psychological wellbeing including increased levels of stress, anxiety, depression, guilt, anger, and other unwanted emotional states. Apart from being unpleasant, these states can contribute to poor engagement with therapy, poor lifestyle choices and a worsening of important relationships. The research plan involves working with people with cancer to design, create and test the intervention, with an initial co design workshop and 3 or 4 cycles of testing and improvement. Once a high enough quality version has been developed we will conduct research into the impact of the intervention and experience on the psychological wellbeing and stress levels of people with cancer. Once this project has been completed we will be a very good position to progress to a full randomised clinical trial of the intervention. The anticipated impact of the study findings for people affected by cancer include thousands of people affected by cancer having rapid access to high quality, calm, soothing virtual environments and quality controlled psychological exercises and activities likely to be associated with reduce stress levels, reduced levels of emotions such as anxiety, depression, shame and guilt, and improved levels of psychological wellbeing, inner peace, quality of life and life functioning.",- People affected by cancer - Aged over 18 years - Able to provide written consent

Patients with high risk SMM transform with a median of two years into active myeloma. A recent consensus of international myeloma experts defined a new group of patients with âearly myelomaâ. Those patients present with one of the newly established âSLiM CRABâ criteria, BMPC (bone marrow plasma cells) > = 60%, or FLC (free light chain) ratio > = 100, and or > 1 MRI detected focal lesion. Their risk for developing active, CRAB positive myeloma with 2 years varies between 64% and 95%. Denosumab a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and neutralises RANKL, has been shown to reduce the rates of skeletal-related events (SRE). It is currently approved for the prevention of SRE in adults with advanced malignancies involving bone and to treat patient with multiple myeloma. This is a randomised controlled phase II trial which aims to evaluate whether the reported benefits of denosumab, delay of SRE and decrease in myeloma growth promotion, reduce the risk of progression of high-risk SMM and of early âSLiM CRABâ myeloma into active CRAB positive myeloma. Approximately 50 patients with high risk SMM or SLiM CRAB are expected to be recruited from 7 sites within the UK over 2.5 years. Patients consenting to enter the trial will undergo a number of investigations during the screening process to assess their eligibility for the trial. Eligible patients will be randomised to receive treatment with either Denosumab or placebo every 4 weeks for 6 months, then every 3 months for a total of 3 years or until progression to active MM.

2,Neoplasms,Malignant neoplasm of breast,An observational study exploring treatment for women newly presenting with breast cancer-related upper limb lymphoedema.,"Lymphoedema affects approximately 20% women following breast cancer treatment. Without effective treatment symptoms worsen, e.g. increased arm size, denser arm, increased infection risk, lymphoedema more visible to others, difficulty with daily activities. Current treatment is based on âbest practiceâ, but we have no evidence for the most effective treatment to be given women when they first develop lymphoedema. Before undertaking an effectiveness study we need to know whether it is possible to conduct such a study. For example: how many participants should we recruit? can we recruit and retain enough participants? which interventions and assessment tools are acceptable to patients and practitioners? what primary (main) outcome should we use to detect a difference between intervention and comparator groups? This study aims to answers these questions. Participants will be women who developed lymphoedema symptoms within the previous 12 months but have not yet received treatment. They are recruited immediately following their first Lymphoedema Clinic appointment, and randomly allocated to one of two intervention groups or comparator group. All participants are given âusualâ UK lymphoedema care. Intervention group participants receive 10 extra treatment sessions over 2 week period followed by âusualâ care.

4,"Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases",Diabetes mellitus,THE IMPACT OF OBESITY AND TYPE 2 DIABETES ON INFLAMMATION AND HEALTH,"We are now beginning to understand that inflammation appears to significantly contribute to people developing diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and fatty liver disease. We understand the factors released from fat increase the inflammation, as such people with obesity have an increased risk of developing diabetes, fatty liver disease and cardiovascular disease. However we are unclear what may act as the factors that cause the fat to produce an inflammatory response which can act on other tissues and systems and how this may effect the health of the patient. Our work within the team has begun to show that bacterial fragments derived from the gut, referred to as endotoxin, can enter the circulation. These fragments are usually removed by the liver and good circulating fats but in people with diabetes and similar disorders this appears to fail, and the bacterial fragments appear to activate fat to produce an inflammatory response. We also understand that low levels of micronutrients such as Vitamin B12 can also impact on inflammatory processes. Currently we are still unclear on how bacterial fragments, and micronutrients that circulate in the blood act on different tissues including muscle and fat to cause differing inflammatory responses. Bariatric surgery has been shown to reduce inflammation at 1 year as measured by endotoxin and highly sensitive CRP, yet this surgery has a major impact on micronutrients and gut flora, therefore we wish to measure the levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors including current or novel biomarkers pre and post surgery and how adipose tissue changes, contributes to metabolic recovery.","Women , age >18 years and <65 Obese patients (Body Mass Index over 30 kg/m2) planned for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy as part of the clinical care Control subjects who are lean (BMI 18-25 kg/m2), overweight (BMI 25.1-30 kg/m2) and obese (BMI >30 kg/m2), who are undergoing elective (non-bariatric) surgery this will include (C-section surgery from pregnant women)."

Whilst cancer accounts for 28 percent of all-cause mortality within the UK, overall survival for people with cancer has doubled in the last 40 years. Surgery to remove the cancer remains the first option for treating cancer in most instances, but it can be associated with significant morbidity and deterioration in quality of life. This has resulted in the drive for additional options for both primary treatment and as adjunct therapy. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are currently the mainstays of adjunct therapy, but the utility and effectiveness vary between cancer types. They are associated with significant morbidity and adverse effects on quality of life, whilst the overall survival benefit is unclear in many types of cancer. As a result, there is an increased focus on the function and quality of life of those patients surviving their cancer treatments. High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a method of accurately delivering ablative ultrasound (US) generated high temperatures nonâinvasively to specific areas in the body using image (ultrasound or MR) guidance. It is currently used for prostate cancer; and there is also evidence it may be effective in treating recurrent prostate cancer. Short and medium-term data demonstrate that HIFU may be equivalent to some current prostate cancer therapies but with reduced morbidity. Despite the success and promise of HIFU as a treatment for prostate cancer, it is not widely used for other cancer types. To explore the possibility of new treatment targets we need to understand the impact of HIFU on surrounding tissues and organs. To accomplish this, we will perform a laboratory study on tissue samples to look at the effect of HIFU on the target tissue and surrounding structures.",1. Histologically confirmed malignancy 2.

2,Neoplasms,"Malignant neoplasms of ill-defined, secondary and unspecified sites",The Two Week Wait (2WW) study - an investigation of patient non-attendance at urgent referral appointments for suspected cancer.,"Since 2000, NHS patients with suspected cancer have been guaranteed to see a hospital specialist within two weeks of the GP requesting an urgent referral - a Two Week Wait (2WW) appointment. This policy intended to shorten time to diagnosis and treatment, and ultimately improve survival rates. In 2014, there were over 22,000 referrals in Leeds, approximately 10% resulted in a cancer diagnosis. However, a significant minority of patients are not seen within two weeks, largely due to patients not attending, cancelling or postponing the appointment. In 2012-2013, 16.5% of 2WW referred patients in the West Leeds Clinical Commissioning Group were not seen in two weeks. This study aims to investigate the reasons for non-attendance and identify interventions to improve timely access to urgent care. This study will be completed in five phases: Phase 1 - Categorisation of patients not seen within two weeks of referral drawing on Leeds NHS Hospital Trust data for approximately 6,000 patients in 2014 and 2015. Phase 2 - Analyse variation in factors between patients who postpone or cancel their appointment, and those who do attend, to identify predictors of non-attendance. This will use cross-sectional analyses within the same data set as Phase 1. Phase 3 - Compare rates of cancer diagnosis (and cancer stage at diagnosis) in attending patients with those who postpone, cancel or do not attend to assess the significance of non-attendance.

Sampling for GPs will aim for maximal sampling variation based on the following criteria: - practices with high and low rates of 2WW referrals, practices with high and low rates of DNAs for 2WW referrals (following adjustment for list size and patient age), urban, rural and remote practice locations, deprivation scores of practice catchment areasÍ¾ - individual GPs: gender and years of experience practicing in the UK. Phase 5 will include a sub-sample of patient and GP participants from Phase 4 who have expressed a willingness and interest in taking part in a workshop to discuss potential interventions to address the barriers to timely attendance and ideally, with the same sampling criteria for Phase 4 to achieve a similar range of variation."
13,Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue,Other joint disorders,The prevalence and impact of blood induced ankle arthritis in patients with moderate and severe haemophilia A and B: The HAPII study,"Haemophilia impairs bleeding control because of an absence of clotting factor VIII (haemophilia A) or factor IX (haemophilia B) resulting in bleeding into muscles and joints. Although treatment with artificial clotting factor has some effect on frequency of bleeds, most patients still experience ongoing spontaneous and traumatic bleeds in joints. Prolonged exposure of joint structures to blood leads to cartilage, structural and functional damage, ultimately resulting in pain and disability. Damage also leads to changes in joint function furthering the risk of subsequent mechanical joint and soft tissue haemorrhage. Ultimately, this vicious cycle results in cumulative and irreversible damage to joints with severe reduction in mobility. The introduction of clotting factor substitution, both prophylactically and on-demand, has dramatically improved life expectancy and quality of life in patients with haemophilia. The paradigm shift from treating a bleeding episode, to prevention with regular replacement therapy (prophylaxis) has seen a reduction in bleeding frequency. Since the introduction of clotting factor, the most common site for musculoskeletal bleeding has also changed from the knee to the tibiotalar (ankle) joint. Bleeding into the ankle joint is now estimated to account for 20% of all haemophilia-related bleeds in the UK. Despite this, little has been reported on the prevalence and impact of chronic ankle haemarthrosis.",Prevalence and impact study a) A consultant diagnosis of haemarthrosis induced ankle arthritis b) Haemophilia A and B c) Moderate or severe haemophilia diagnosed by level of clotting factor activity d) Aged 16 or over e) Participants who are able to give informed written consent f) Male g) The ability to read and understand English f) Consultant haematologist (online survey)
2,Neoplasms,Malignant neoplasms of male genital organs,"Randomised phase 3 trial of enzalutamide in androgen deprivation therapy with radiation therapy for high risk, clinically localised, prostate cancer","Participants are invited to take part in this research study that is testing a new treatment combination for localised prostate cancer that is going to be treated with radiotherapy. This is because they have prostate cancer that has features suggesting that its risk of recurrence after radiotherapy is higher than average. Current treatment for high risk localised prostate cancer involves radiation therapy with or without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Androgen deprivation therapy can have two components: 1. The main component is by stopping the release of androgen from the testicles. This is mainly done by using drugs that prevent the testicles from making androgens, and therefore reducing the levels of androgens in the body to low levels. These drugs are called luteinising releasing hormone analogues (LHRHA). This is usually part of the standard initial treatment of men in this situation. 2. The second component blocks the effects of androgens produced in other parts of the body with anti-androgen drugs. Anti-androgen drugs block testosterone and related androgens from attaching to molecules in the cancer cell called âandrogen receptors.â Blocking this attachment prevents androgens from having their effect. This might provide additional benefit in treating the cancer although this has not yet been proven. Several different types of anti-androgen drugs are available for use already. Enzalutamide is an anti-androgen drug approved for use in Europe for the treatment of adult men with metastatic prostate cancer that has continued to grow after hormone treatments and chemotherapy. The use of enzalutamide is currently experimental for localised prostate cancer. The treatment plan for these participants is androgen deprivation therapy combined with external beam radiotherapy to prevent further growth and spread of the prostate cancer. All participants will receive LHRHA treatment for 24 months and radiotherapy. Radiotherapy is standard practice and is not under investigation in this trial. Participants will be randomly allocated to either receive enzalutamide for 24 months or currently available anti-androgen therapy for 6 months. The study will compare the effectiveness of standard deprivation therapy and radiation therapy combined either with enzalutamide or with currently available anti-androgen drugs. The main aim of the study is to see which of these combinations of treatment is better for improving the survival of men in this situation. Recent studies show promising results from the use of enzalutamide in patients who had been treated with androgen deprivation therapy and were no longer responding to the standard anti-androgens. These men had prostate cancer that is at a more advanced stage than the stage of prostate cancer studied here. We want to see whether this positive effect can also be shown in men with high risk prostate cancer localised to the prostate area and planned for radiotherapy. This is the first study evaluating the potential benefit of enzalutamide in this patient group. To do this, a total of 800 participants will participate where half the participants on the study will receive enzalutamide with a LHRHA and radiation therapy and the other half (400 participants) will receive an already available anti-androgen with a LHRHA and radiation therapy. All participants on this study will receive active therapy and no placebo treatment will be used. The study is open label, meaning that both the participants and the investigators will know the treatment the participant will receive.","1.

5,Mental and behavioural disorders,Mood [affective] disorders,The Modular Protocol For Mental Health (MP:MH): A pilot randomised clinical trial of a transdiagnostic psychological treatment for mood and anxiety disorders in adults,"Anxiety and mood disorders are common conditions affecting up to 20% of adults. These conditions take different forms (or diagnoses) such as Agoraphobia, Panic Disorder, Depressive Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, and so on. Currently, our best non-drug (psychological) treatments only focus on individual diagnoses. So, there are separate treatments for Panic Disorder, or Depressive Disorder, or Social Anxiety, etc. These 'diagnosis-specific' treatments work well for people whose problems fit neatly into a single diagnosis. However, they work far less well for people with complex problems involving multiple diagnoses? e.g., someone who is depressed and socially anxious and suffering panic attacks. In fact, 50% of patients fail to repond well to these existing treatments. We have therefore developed a new psychological treatment for anxiety and mood problems (the Modular Protocol for Mental Health [MPMH]). Instead of focusing on any single diagnosis, MPMH combines the best treatment techniques into 10 modules (with clinician instructions and materials for service-users) each of which targets problems common across all of the different mood and anxiety diagnoses (e.g., intense emotions, negative thinking, upsetting memories, distressing habits). MP:MH should therefore be a better treatment for the large numbers of individuals whose problems do not fit neatly into a single diagnosis and for whom any treatments targeting a single diagnosis would leave significant difficulties unaddressed. We have tested MPMH on a series of people ('cases'), each with a complex mixture of anxiety and mood disorders, with promising results. In this study we are examining how well MP:MH works for these more complex cases, compared to the standard treatment people receive in NHS Secondary Care. The proposed trial is a patient level twoarm trial that compares MPMH to treatment as usual for patients aged >18 years (N=50) with co-morbid mood, anxiety or stress-disorder diagnoses recruited from secondary care (the Affective Disorders Pathway of the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust? CPFT).","Patients aged over 18 with a primary diagnosis of a unipolar mood, anxiety or stress disorder according to the DSM-5will be eligible for inclusion. The criteria for diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety disorder will be based on the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM (SCID-I/NP) which assesses disorders according to DSM diagnostic criteria. Participants will also need to score >10 on either the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) or Generalised Anxiety Disorder -7 item scale (GAD-7). Eligible participants will be prepared to: provide their name, phone number and address? provide the name and address of a local general practitioner? provide written informed consent? and be available to attend regular (i.e., weekly) sessions throughout treatment"
13,Mental and behavioural disorders,"Neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders",Children with OCD: Identifying Acceptable Support Strategies for Parents (CO-ASSIST),"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a severe and debilitating emotional disorder that frequently begins in childhood. The effect of obsessions and compulsions are not only distressing for a child experiencing them but also for the childâs parents/ carers. Without adequate support, the role of caring for children and young people can pose a significant burden to parents/carers. There is currently little evidence on how parents/carers and professionals view parental/carer support needs or the help they would find most useful. For this study funded by the NIHR Research for Patient Benefits programme, we will use qualitative mixed methods to identify workable ways of providing support that would meet the needs of parents/carers of children with OCD. Participants will be recruited from a range of NHS and third sector services and settings. The study has three phases, which will include a different set of participants for each phase (though some overlap is possible). Phase 1) We will invite 25-30 parents/carers to participate in a one-one interview. Separately we will hold 3-4 focus groups (of 6-8) with professionals who work with young people with OCD. Interviews and focus groups will be used to better understand parent/carer support needs. Phase 2) We will invite 18-25 key stakeholders (parents/carers, charities, clinicians, OCD researchers) to attend a one-day event where evidence from phase 1 will be discussed to identify strategies and resources to meet parents/carers needs. Phase 3) A panel of ten parents/carers and professionals will attend a meeting to discuss findings from phase 2 in order to inform the design of a potential intervention to support parents/carers of children with OCD. This study was initiated and designed through consultation with UK OCD charities and parents/carers and PPI involvement will continue throughout the research process. NB. All research activities will be undertaken remotely due to Covid-19.","Parent Sample: Parents/carers of children or young people aged 8-18 who have a diagnosis of OCD. The specified age range criteria for CYP is in accordance with NICE Clinical Guidelines for OCD (2005) which cover individuals from a minimum age of 8, the earliest point at which a diagnosis can usually be determined. We will also include parents of children who have recently (defined as within the last year) exceeded the age of 18 or who are not currently in their caregiver role, yet whose parenting/caring experience is still reflective of the needs of current parents/carers of CYP in this age range. A parentsâ/carersâ self-reported acknowledgement of their childâs formal diagnosis of OCD is adequate to meet to the objective of this study, avoiding the need for more formal potentially intrusive methods involving a formal proxy diagnostic measures or access to medical notes.Interpreters will be available for participants who are unable to speak English.

Version 1.,"Title Service Usersâ Perspectives on Accessing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Services within the East Riding of Yorkshire Background In the UK, 3.2 million people were diagnosed with diabetes in 2013 of which 90% of people are diagnosed with type 2. Diabetes related complications incur significant costs to the patient and NHS. To reduce the risk of complications NICE recommends yearly health checks and treatment targets. For people with type 2 diabetes in the East Riding of Yorkshire, 71.7% received all care processes, whilst only 37.8% achieved the treatment targets. Rational Capturing the perceptions of type 2 diabetes service users in the East Riding of Yorkshire will give further insight into the reasons for not meeting guidelines on reducing the risk of associated diabetes complications. Potential Benefits The findings will support relevant parties to further deliver effective, service user driven care within the East Riding of Yorkshire to suit type 2 diabetes service usersâ needs in conjunction with delivering national and local standards of care. This may help to reduce spending. Study Design This study will be undertaken using sequential mixed research methods, taking a two staged approach.

5,Mental and behavioural disorders,"Schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders",A Community-Based Intervention to Improve Health-Related Quality of Life in Children and adolescents of Parents with Serious Mental Illness: Feasibility Study,"Many children grow up with a parent who is experiencing a mental illness. These may be mild, short-term illnesses that are easily treatableÍ¾ however, some parental mental illness is severe and long-standing such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Studies have shown that children living or in regular contact with a parent with a severe mental illness, can be vulnerable to maltreatment, neglect and stigma and are at risk of developing mental health or behavioural problems, leading to a poor quality of life (QoL). Since 2011, the NSPCC has been providing and evaluating a programme called Family SMILES which aims to improve childrenâs self-esteem, enhance parentsâ protective abilities and improve parent-child relationships. This 3-year study builds on the NSPCCâs Family SMILES programme to produce an enhanced intervention, called Young SMILES, which aims to produce specific benefits for childrenâs health and functioning, and can be flexibly delivered within and outside NHS services. In Phase I (approved - 198409) we worked with children and parents/carers with severe mental illness, adults who had grown up with mentally ill parents, health, social care, education and voluntary sector professionals to develop Young SMILES. In Phase II 60 families will take part in a feasibility Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) over 12-months. Half will receive Young SMILES and half usual care. We will collect data at the start (baseline), 3 months (primary endpoint),at 6 and 12 months follow-up, on childrenâs health-related QoL, mental health literacy and problem-solving, depression and anxiety, family functioning and parent-child relationship, health and social care use. Practitioners from the NHS, Social Care and the Voluntary Sector will deliver the intervention. We will look at recruitment rates, randomisation procedures, intervention adherence and drop-out, describe the outcomes and costs and identify the most appropriate way to carry out a future larger-scale RCT.","1.

Therefore, we do not intend to carry out full clinical interviews with the parents and report diagnostic codes. We shall accept the primary and secondary diagnoses reported by a key health professional, such as the GP, care coordinator and key worker, as most of these parents are likely to receive secondary care or be monitored in primary care.

This would cover a range of areas, such as how the patientsâ mental health is, the level of risk they pose to themselves or other people, how good their quality of life is and how well they are progressing towards rehabilitation back in to society. Professionals working in forensic psychiatric services in the UK will be asked to fill in a survey about what they think are the most important things to measure. There will also be several faceâto-face events, including focus groups of professionals, to further explore the themes that come up. Patients will also be interviewed in depth to gain their views about what is important. A panel of both patients and professionals will be presented with information from the earlier stages and asked to rate the areas that they think are most important to measure. This will happen repeatedly, until there is agreement about the most important areas. The research team will then design questions that address these areas and ask the panel to decide which questions are the best. This will produce a new tool consisting of one set of questions for patients and another for professionals.

4,"Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases",Malnutrition,Managing malnutrition in later life: exploring the views and dietary practices of older people at risk of malnutrition and their carers,"Malnutrition is a serious condition that occurs when a personâs diet lacks the amount of nutrients they need. It is a common problem in older people that can lead to weight loss, weakness and tiredness. If left unchecked, it can cause older people to become underweight, and more prone to severe illness and hospitalisation. Malnutrition can go unnoticed in the early stages as it can be difficult to recognise, and General Practitioners or practice nurses may not have the time or have received training on how to deal with this condition. Currently, little is known about the dietary choices made by older people at risk of malnutrition, how it is recognised and acted upon, and how it can be improved. Alongside this, older people may be prone to dehydration as a result of not drinking enough, loss of fluid or a combination of both. When you get older your sense of thirst can be reduced and you may not realise that you are not drinking enough. Dehydration can make you feel unwell and can lead to hospital admission if not addressed. We currently donât know enough about older peopleâs views around hydration, what they do to make sure they drink enough and what support they might need. In this study, we will interview older people who are underweight or at risk of malnutrition and friend/family carers of older people who need help to prepare their meals. We will explore the decisions they make about the food they buy and eat, their knowledge about dietary needs in later life, the advice and support they might need and the best place to seek support. We will also ask older people and their carers for their views on how primary care could support nutritional and healthy eating and drinking advice e.g. from the GP, practice nurse or health care assistant. This study will lead to further work in which we would explore ways primary care can help older people make changes to their diet in order to maintain a healthy weight and drink enough and receive all the nutrients they need.","Community dwelling people (including those living in supported housing), aged > = 75 years old, identified to be malnourished or at risk of malnutrition (BMI< 20 or estimated to be low by clinician).

Marketing surrounding this product group and the social consequences of acne may result in patient demands or perceived preferences, which may influence the recommendations of health professionals. Although clinical guidelines for acne exist,the role of pharmacists in helping patients to self-care is generally not covered. In the present study we will undertake semi-structured interviews with dermatologists to obtain insight into their perspectives on the management of acne in pharmacies. The data generated from these interviews will aid the development of questions for a Delphi process in an attempt to gain consensus from an expert panel on the severity of acne which should be managed in pharmacies, the criteria that should prompt pharmacists to refer patients with acne to their GP and the most suitable over the counter treatment options for acne. This information will be used to aid the development of a guideline that can be used to help pharmacists who request treatment for acne in pharmacies. We will also conduct semi-structured interviews with the pharmacists who have used the guideline in practice to explore their views on the usefulness of the guideline in practice.","For the dermatologists: 1.

Hearing loss increases dementia risk more than lacking education, being diabetic or depressed or having a poor diet. Therefore, untreated hearing loss may be a missed opportunity to delay and prevent dementia in a substantial number of people, but we need research to find out if treating hearing loss is effective. We want to find out if a hearing aid intervention can prevent or delay the onset of dementia in older adults who are at greater risk of developing dementia (i.e. those with mild cognitive impairment). Before we can do a full trial to answer this question, we need to run a pilot trial to see if we can recruit participants and assess the acceptability of the proposed interventions. We plan to compare two interventions in this pilot trial. The hearing intervention will involve hearing aid provision and support over four sessions, while the healthy ageing intervention will involve standard audiological care (i.e. the participant will be informed of their hearing loss and advised to see their GP) and four one-to-one sessions with a researcher on behavioural changes that can promote healthy ageing and may reduce risk of progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. We will recruit people aged 55 years and over, who have a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and evidence of hearing loss. Participants will be recruited from local London memory services and the trial visits will be conducted in the participantsâ homes.

6,Diseases of the nervous system,Other degenerative diseases of the nervous system,Oxford Genetic Frontotemporal Dementia Initiative (Oxford GENFI),"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a common cause of young onset dementia. Its effect on people of working age with young families represents a major health and economic burden on society. The only known risk factors for FTD at present are genetic with abnormalities (mutations) in three genes accounting for the majority of familial FTD. There are now promising avenues for treatment of these disorders but we still do not know when drugs should be started or how we should measure the response to treatment. This study investigates people with or who are at genetic risk of FTD, including people who have developed symptoms and those who have a high risk of developing symptoms in the future because they are family members of someone who carries an FTD gene. Study participants will have psychology testing, brain imaging, blood tests and spinal fluid collection (by lumbar puncture) in order to investigate the patterns of change in these different tests over time. The results will help us to understand the disease from its very earliest stages. It is expected that 80 participants will be seen in Oxford, being assessed three times in total. The key outcomes of the study are to (1) improve understanding of how brain systems break down in genetic FTD and how this break down relates to the underlying behavioural and cognitive deficits, (2) develop markers which help identify the disease at its earliest stage, and (3) develop markers that allow the progression of the disease to be tracked. The eventual aim will be to use these markers in future clinical trials of drugs in genetic FTD. The results of this project will also lead to improvement in the recognition and diagnosis of genetic FTD as well as provide improved information about prognosis for patients and members of their family.","1.

2,Neoplasms,Malignant neoplasms of thyroid and other endocrine glands,A phase I/II study evaluating the safety and activity of Pegylated recombinant human Arginase (BCT-100) in Relapsed/refractory cancers of Children and young adults,"PARC is an international phase I/II trial evaluating the safety and activity of pegylated recombinant human arginase (BCT-100) in children and young people with relapsed/refractory leukaemia, neuroblastoma, sarcoma and high grade gliomas (brain cancers). Currently the outcomes for these patients are poor and the therapeutic options are limited with a significant toxicity burden. Therefore new treatments which work in different ways to standard chemotherapy are urgently needed. Research has shown that arginine (a nutrient) is important in the survival of cancer cells. BCT-100 is a drug which can deplete arginine levels and starve cancer cells â a completely new approach. BCT-100 has been tested in adults and shown to be active with almost no side-effects. This trial will test whether this dose of BCT-100 is also safe and active in children and young adults with relapsed/refractory leukaemia, neuroblastoma, sarcoma and high grade glioma. The trial will also study how BCT-100 is broken down in the body and look for new biological markers of treatment response. Up to 64 children and young adults with relapsed cancers will be recruited over 2 years.","â¢ Aged 1- < 25 years old â¢ Histologically confirmed disease in one of the following four cohorts.

9,Diseases of the circulatory system,Ischaemic heart diseases,Dose Effect Relationship of a Single Dose of Rituximab on the Kinetics of B Lymphocytes in Patients with Acute STSegment Myocardial Infarction,"Heart attacks are caused by blockages of arteries in the heart. This is treated by unblocking the artery with a balloon and stent during a procedure called primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). Despite this therapeutic advance, up to 50% of the final heart attack size is caused by this treatment, by a process termed reperfusion injury. Reperfusion injury contributes to the persistent morbidity and mortality suffered by 15% of heart attack patients at 6 months, despite successful PPCI. The immune system plays a pivotal role in orchestrating reperfusion injury. We have demonstrated in animal models that selective depletion of B cells reduces the size of the heart attack size and preserves heart function. The objective of RITA-MI is to assess if a CD20 monocolonal antibody - rituximab, used to successfully treat rheumatoid arthritis, can be repurposed to safely suppress the B cell immune response at the time of an acute heart attack, thereby allowing further study into its ability to reduce heart attack size, promote healing and thereby improving clinical outcome.",1.

1,Certain infectious and parasitic diseases,Tuberculosis,The role of viral coinfection in the progression of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in children,"Every year, about one million children are diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) and about 250,000 of them die. TB is caused by infection with the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Following exposure to Mtb, children are at much greater risk of developing TB disease than adults and they are more prone to severe disease. Differences in how their immune systems function are thought to underlie this, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood. Children are exposed to multiple infectious agents which may change the functioning of their immune systems and how they control other infections. Evidence suggests that immunological changes induced by viral coinfections may increase susceptibility to TB disease, but there are few studies. Studies exploring interactions between Mtb, viral coinfections and the immune system will help our understanding of the immune responses important for controlling TB infection. This knowledge could contribute towards the development of improved vaccines, immunotherapies and diagnostics. Understanding whether viral coinfections change the risk of developing TB disease is also important for clinical management and public health policies. This study will compare blood sampled from children during an acute viral infection and when well, and from adult and paediatric healthy controls. In the laboratory we will infect the blood samples with mycobacteria and look to see whether there are differences in how the mycobacteria grow. In order to understand the mechanisms behind any observed differences, we will also measure and compare immune responses in the blood. We will look to see if age affects mycobacterial growth and immune responses. We will also compare blood sampled from children before and after immunisation, so as to study the influence of vaccines on mycobacterial immune responses. This in turn should increase our understanding of the effects of infections, such as measles, on mycobacterial containment.","PAEDIATRIC SUBJECTS 1. Child is aged 0- < 18 years AND 2.

6,Diseases of the nervous system,Diseases of myoneural junction and muscle,Immune Factors in Neurological Diseases,"Neurological disorders are often difficult to treat. We, and other clinical researchers, have shown an autoimmune, usually antibody mediated, cause for some such conditions in several studies. Affected patients are of both sexes, all ages and all races. Examples include, myasthenia gravis and, most recently, novel forms of encephalitis and epilepsy. The presence of an immune component to a neurological disease offers clinicians the opportunity to treat patients with drugs which suppress the immune system, such as steroids. This is an exploratory study to examine longitudinal observational clinical data from patients with a possible autoimmune component to their neurological condition. The study aims to correlate these clinical findings with laboratory immunological findings from bodily fluids (blood, spinal fluid, urine and saliva) using both established and novel assays and determine the clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients who respond to immune-therapies. This clinical and immunological characterisation will allow description of associated phenotypes, biomarkers and responses to treatments. This will be true for both well-established and novel antibodies or immunological parameters. Further cellular and other immunogenetic laboratory work will seek to understand the biology of neurological conditions, predisposing factors and to identify possible targets for future drug development.","Patients: â¢ There is or may be an autoimmune component to their neurological disease. â¢ Individual and/or parent/guardian willing to give informed consent for participation in the study OR: â¢ where an individual is deemed to lack capacity to consent, a declaration from a designated consultee.

14,Diseases of the genitourinary system,Renal failure,Progression of Arterial and Cardiac disease in Kidney patients and controls - An extended study (PACK-Extended),"Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects 10-15% of the general population. CKD patients suffer from higher risks of heart attacks and strokes. The exact nature of why there is an increased risk is unknown. We have, through a previous study, demonstrated in patients in different stages of CKD and kidney transplant patients have highly abnormal blood vessel reactivity, thickened blood vessel walls, and atherosclerosis (furring) within the blood vessel. Although we know inflammation causes the abnormal blood vessel reactivity, which in turn causes the atherosclerosis. No study has examined the natural and long-term progression of blood vessel reactivity, blood vessel wall thickness, and furring of blood vessels in CKD and transplant patients. This study hopes to look at the natural progression of these blood vessel parameters, the reactivity, wall thickness, and furring of the blood vessels. We will be looking at these parameters by measuring Brachial Artery Flow Mediated Dilation (Ultrasound scan on the arm), carotid and brachial intima-media thickness (Ultrasound scan on arm and neck), carotid-femoral wave velocity (a pressure probe placed on neck and groin), ankle-brachial index (blood pressure measurements on arm and leg), 12-lead electrocardiogram (heart tracing) and blood tests. As we will recruit patients who have previously participated within the Progression of Atherosclerosis in Chronic Kidney Disease (PACK) study, we will evaluate the changes in these parameters that occurred over the 1-2 years between PACK and this study. No new patients will be recruited into this study. All the examinations on research participants will be completed within a day in the Vascular Laboratory at the Cardiovascular Sciences Research Centre of St Georgeâs University of London. This new information on the natural progression of blood vessel parameters may help guide treatment in reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes of CKD patients in the future.",- Age 18-80 - Stable kidney functions for 3 months or stable on dialysis for 3 months The proposed study will involve patient groups as follows: 1.

2,Neoplasms,"Malignant neoplasms of ill-defined, secondary and unspecified sites",An investigation describing the Long and Short-Term effects of Standard-of-Care treatments for people with Cancer,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPI) are drugs that release cancer immunity. ICPI cause immune attack on normal organs resulting in immune related adverse events (IrAE) including bowel inflammation called immune related colitis (IR-colitis). We will describe the clinical and pathological features of IR-colitis, exploring a role for viruses including Epstein Barr virus (EBV) which lives harmlessly in most people. More broadly, the study will explore clinical, pathological and microbiological features associated with ICPI treatment, cancer control and IrAE. At the University Hospitals Birmingham, we will recruit fifty consenting people treated with ICPI at standard of care clinic appointments. We will take scheduled blood and body product samples before during and after treatment induction. Also, we will recruit groups of around ten consenting patients for particular experiments, requesting unscheduled samples. This may include additional tissue sampling during standard procedures or additional non-invasive biopsies. These may include people presenting with IR-colitis, treated with ICPI, with other IrAE, with cancer without ICPI treatment, with colitis for other reasons, and healthy volunteers. Samples from these groups may be used to characterise the values or variation of particular measurements to better understand their meaning in the main cohort. Retrospective clinical data and archival pathology samples surplus to clinical need will be explored in relation to specific questions relating to ICPI treatment, IrAE and cancer control within scope of the project. In particular, we will focus on data and samples relating to previous episodes of IR-colitis, inflammatory bowel disease and EBV-lymphoproliferation and will seek evidence of reactivation of EBV and other viruses. At NHS centres in England and Wales, clinical data with linked archival tissue will be collated by clinical care teams. Fully anonymised data and material will be analysed at the University of Birmingham. Consent will not be sought for use of fully anonymised data and samples.","Prospective cancer patient cohorts (i) Written informed consent (ii) Adult 18+ (iii) A diagnosis of cancer (iv) About to start, started or completed standard-of-care ICPI or non-ICPI therapy (v) Performance status 0-1 (i.e. active and independent, undertaking light activities or work) (vi) Life expectancy based on volume of disease and co-morbidity at least three months Non-cancer patients (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease) (i) Written informed consent (ii) Adult 18+ (iii) Known diagnosis of a non-cancer condition Healthy volunteers (i) Written informed consent (ii) Adult 18+ No formal eligibility criteria apply to retrospective studies"
