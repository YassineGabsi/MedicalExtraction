17,"Congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities",Congenital malformations and deformations of the musculoskeletal system,"An exploratory, open label, multiple dose, multicentre phase I/II trial evaluating safety and efficacy of postnatal or prenatal and postnatal intravenous administration of allogeneic expanded fetal mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of severe Osteogenesis Imperfecta compared with a combination of historical and untreated prospective controls.","The BOOSTB4 trial aims to investigate whether administration of allogeneic (un-matched) fetal mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs, ""BOOST cells"") are a safe and effective treatment for severe types of Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI). BOOST cells will be given either after birth to babies with OI or before birth to babies in the womb (fetus) that have a confirmed molecular diagnosis of OI. OI patients suffer with repeated painful fractures, bony deformities and short stature. There are no treatments for this debilitating condition which target the underlying pathology. In preclinical (animal) studies, MSCs improve the growth and reduce the fracture rate and bone fragility in mice with OI. MSCs have been administered to a small number of fetuses and babies with OI who appear to have had better outcomes than would otherwise have been expected. Worldwide, MSCs have been used to treat many other conditions and appear to be safe, with no evidence of tumour formation and few side effects. We aim to give the BOOST MSCs to 15 babies aged up to 12 months of age (Part 1) and 15 fetuses at 16-35+6 weeks of gestational age (Part 2). The babies or fetuses will each receive a total of 4 doses of MSC, given four months apart. For fetal (prenatal) participants, the first dose will be given as an ultrasound-guided injection into the umbilical cord. Short term follow up will be for 1 year, with long term follow up until 10 years after 1st dose (or age 10 for prenatal participants). Participants will be matched with prospective or historical untreated OI control patients. The trial is sponsored by the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden. Within the UK, the study will be conducted at University College London Hospital and Great Ormond Street Hospital. There are 3 additional sites within Europe.","Postnatal group Infants diagnosed with OI type III or severe OI type IV postnatally and prenatally diagnosed cases who did not consent to prenatal administration. 1.

9,Diseases of the circulatory system,Pulmonary heart disease and diseases of pulmonary circulation,Investigation into conductive and arrhythmogenic properties of the right atrium and ventricle in patients with pulmonary hypertension,"Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is a common and important clinical condition with a significant degree of associated morbidity and mortality. Much of this is due to the high incidence of cardiac arrhythmias in these patients, the presence of which have been shown to correlate with worse prognosis. Very little is understood about the mechanisms underlying these arrhythmias however. We plan to study the heart muscle conduction characteristics of patients with PH undergoing ablation procedures as part of their clinical care. Firstly, using wires (catheters) inserted peripherally via the femoral vein and passed up to the heart we can create a 3 dimensional map of the heart using specialised software. These catheters are also capable of measuring local electrical activation in heart tissue with which they are in contact. We can thus create a model of electrical activation and map areas of scar in the heart chambers of interest. Secondly, a group of PH patients undergoing MRI scans of the heart for clinical purposes will be identified for non-invasive mapping using novel Electrocardiographic Imaging (ECGI) technology. This involves wearing a multi-electrode vest for the duration of the MRI scan and a short period before or after. Using anatomical information gleaned from the scan and electrical information gleaned from the multi-electrode vest a similar 3 dimensional map of the heart can be created without the need for invasive catheter manipulation. By identifying and characterising arrhythmia mechanisms in patients with PH we hope to better understand how these arrhythmias arise, how they correlate to prognosis and how to target therapy appropriately.","All patients with pulmonary hypertension who are scheduled to undergo an EP study and ablation procedure, or cardiac MRI scan will be eligible."
2,Neoplasms,"Malignant neoplasms, stated or presumed to be primary, of lymphoid, haematopoietic and related tissue","A prospective, multicentre European Registry for newly diagnosed patients with Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS), including acute myeloid leukaemia with 20-30 percent marrow blasts (former RAEB-t), and Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukaemia (CMML).","The European MDS Registry (EUMDS) started as an observational pan-European study aiming to prospectively collect longitudinal data from a large number of lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients in April 2008. The registry has evolved into a valuable source containing data on diagnostics, demographics, clinical parameters, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), disease-management and outcome of over 2000 newly diagnosed lower-risk (IPSS low and intermediate-1) MDS patient across 142 centres in 17 countries. In a number of these countries, national MDS Registration projects are ongoing aiming at improving the knowledge of the local incidence and management of these patients. The EUMDS registry serves as a central international registry, using the national MDS Registries that are represented within the European LeukemiaNet MDS Working Party (ELN WP8) as the platform for registration, to study the demographics, disease-management and treatment outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed MDS more comprehensively. The aim in the next phase of the EUMDS Registry is to extend the current registry to a general MDS registry including higher-risk (IPSS intermediate-2 and high-risk), therapy-related MDS and MDS-F, AML with 20-30 percent marrow blasts (former RAEB-t), CMML and other forms of mixed MDS/MPD.",Patients must meet all of the following criteria to be included in the European MDS Registry: - Age > 18 years - Newly diagnosed patient (within 100 days from the date of the diagnostic BM aspirate) -MDS classified according to current WHO criteria (both 2008 [8] and 2016 [10] will be recorded)3 - All sub groups of MDS -Therapy-related MDS -MDS with Fibrosis (MDS-F) -AML with 20-30 percent marrow blasts (former RAEB-t) -CMML and other forms of mixed MDS/MPD -IPSS and IPSS-R Risk group classification (mandatory)4 -Able and willing to provide the written informed consent
1,Certain infectious and parasitic diseases,Infections with a predominantly sexual mode of transmission,A Point of care antimicrobial resistance test for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Mycoplasma genitalium infection â ensuring accurate therapy and antibiotic stewardship in sexual health medicine.,"Testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) enables diagnosis and appropriate clinical management of individuals, thus preventing serious health consequences. It is an important public health intervention with potential to reduce onward transmission of infection to sexual partners, and reducing the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). New technologies, including point of care tests (POCTs), especially those that combine detection of the pathogen and AMR, may help overcome challenges of STI prevention by enabling immediate diagnosis and appropriate treatment, improving partner notification, quality of patient care and antibiotic stewardship. Through a three-year NIHR i4i-funded grant (II-LB-0214-20005), the team at St Georgeâs University of London have been working with Atlas Genetics, to develop a POCT for diagnosis and AMR for the two STIs Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Mycoplasma genitalium (MG). We are now able to conduct a prospective diagnostic accuracy study of the test using patient-consented (additional to routine) clinical samples, to evaluate the Atlas io platforms and its associated cartridges. For NG, the primary outcome is to set the detection level whereby samples are considered negative and assess the testâs utility as a reflex test for patients already diagnosed with NG. For MG, we will look at the accuracy of detection and AMR. Secondary outcomes are an epidemiological description of the recruited population, and modelling clinical impact of POCTs. We will work with Atlas Genetics and a number of UK NHS Genitourinary Medicine (GUM) clinics, over 12 months. Following informed consent, females will be asked to provide 2 additional vulvo-vaginal swabs, males an additional portion of first void urine, and men-who-have-sex-with men (MSM) two additional pharyngeal and rectal swabs. The results of the tests will not be used to inform patient care. Participants will only be recruited during one routine clinical visit, no follow up is required.","i) Males and females attending the GUM clinic who are being routinely tested for STIs, including CT and NG (NAATs), as part of their standard care ii) Able to provide written, informed consent; iii) Willing and able to provide: f) Males: The residual of the first catch urine (FCU) sample, minimum 20ml (i.e. (first > = 20ml of the initial urine stream, with the patient not passing urine in the previous 2 hours) g) Females: Three self- or healthcare professional-collected vulvovaginal swabs (VVS) (1 routine collected first, 2 additional-to-routine in eNAT medium (order determined by patient/healthcare professional)) h) MSM: Four healthcare professional-collected pharyngeal swabs (2 routine collected first, 2 additional-to-routine in eNAT medium (order determined by healthcare professional)) i) MSM: Four self- or healthcare professional-collected rectal swabs in eNAT medium (2 routine collected first, 2 additional-to-routine in eNAT medium (order determined by patient/healthcare professional)) iv) Symptomatic or contact of someone with CT/NG/MG/NSU; and v) Patients aged 16 years or over.

5,Mental and behavioural disorders,Mood [affective] disorders,Professional satisfaction and wellbeing among specialty trainees in Anaesthesia within the Southwest of England and Wales; a mixed-methods collaborative study.,"Background Anaesthesia as a medical specialty often produces high levels of professional satisfaction. Despite this, 30% of UK anaesthetists feel stressed âa lot of the timeâ and 5% feel stressed âall the timeâ. For anaesthetists and trainee anaesthetists, high stress levels can lead to depression and burnout syndrome (consisting of emotional exhaustion, having an unfeeling response to oneâs patients and having a sense that oneâs work lacks value). Anaesthetic trainees who experience burnout are more likely to make medication errors and practice less safely, increasing the risk of harm to their patients. Stress, depression and burnout syndrome have never been properly explored in UK anaesthetic trainees. This represents an important safety issue, both for these doctors and the patients they treat. Aims 1. To establish the prevalence of stress, depression and burnout syndrome among anaesthetic trainees within Southwest England and Wales. 2. To identify and explore the potential factors which contribute to these traits. Methods This study is a collaboration between three regional trainee-led research groups. Firstly, we will send a confidential electronic questionnaire to all anaesthetic trainees in Severn, Peninsula and Wales Deaneries (approximately 600). This will collect demographic data and also use well-validated assessment tools to measure the prevalence of depression, burnout, stress and job satisfaction. Secondly, an experienced psychologist will carry out optional and confidential telephone interviews on a sample of those who score both high and low in domains of stress, depression and/or burnout, in order to identify potential contributing and protective factors. Potential Benefits of the Study This study will provide current, accurate information for those involved in educating, supervising and managing UK anaesthetic trainees and may identify opportunities for the modification or management of risk factors implicated in the development of stress, depression or burnout syndrome.","Specialty Trainee in Anaesthesia (+/- Intensive Care Medicine) within Southwest England (Severn and Peninsula Training Deaneries) or Wales (Wales Deanery).

4,"Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases",Diabetes mellitus,Investigating how platelet-derived oncogenic microRNAs (miRNAs) are altering the genetics of breast cancer cells.,"This application is for approval to gain a blood sample from diabetic patients recruited by our clinical collaborator Dr Donald Whitelaw at his clinic. We have funding from the charity Breast Cancer Now to run a three year PhD research project entitled âInvestigating how platelet-derived oncogenic miRNAs are altering the genetics of breast cancer cellsâ. Diabetes is a strong risk factor for developing aggressive, rapidly spreading forms of breast cancer. We have preliminary data demonstrating that platelet blood cells in diabetic patients release small particles (microparticles) that contain specialised chemicals (miRNAs) which may help to promote cancer growth responses. This project will extract microparticles from diabetic patients blood to study how they promote cancer growth responses, and will identify which miRNAs found in the particles from diabetic donors help cancer development.","Adult female diabetic donors with a current active complication of diabetes(Cardiovascular disease,neuropathy, nephropathy or a foot ulcer). The control group of healthy, non-diabetic donors, will be recruited from Bradford University and blood samples will be taken by Bradford University staff at the university."
4,"Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases",Diabetes mellitus,A pilot randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy of sitagliptin in reducing depressive symptoms in patients with comorbid type 2 diabetes and depression,"One in 5 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) has depression. Patients with depression and T2D have more chance of getting complications related to their diabetes (such as stroke and heart attack) and of dying early. However, the reasons for this are not well understood and current treatments for depression do not improve these poor outcomes. Sitagliptin is an established medication for T2D that acts to reduce blood sugars. In addition, Sitagliptin acts to reduce inflammation â the bodyâs normal response to infections but which, if elevated for a long time, may worsen both T2D and depression. In a study of 1735 patients with T2D, we recently observed that those receiving Sitagliptin and related medications experienced an improvement in depression. This improvement correlated with reduction in levels of inflammation, suggesting that Sitagliptin may improve depression by reducing inflammation. We therefore propose a pilot clinical trial of Sitagliptin in 60 patients with T2D and depression. Participants will be recruited from GP surgeries in Lambeth, Southwark and Lewisham. Participants will be randomised to receive either Sitagliptin or placebo daily for 12 weeks. Neither participants nor the trial team will know which treatment any patient is receiving. Before starting treatment and every 4 weeks thereafter, participants will answer two depression questionnaires and have blood tests to measure inflammation and blood sugar control. Although treatment will stop after 12 weeks, participants will continue to be monitored every 4 weeks for a further 12 weeks for depression levels. Participants will be seen at Kingâs College Hospital or their own GP surgery. We propose that Sitagliptin will lead significant improvement in depressive symptoms compared to placebo. If successful, this study will provide the first trial evidence that inflammation is important in the depression of T2D and provide the basis for a larger clinical trial.","1.

4,"Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases",Other nutritional deficiencies,Limited exposure narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) to face and arms using a portable lamp in healthy volunteers and patients with vitamin D insufficiency.,"An adequate vitamin D supply is crucial for bone health and may be important in the prevention of certain cancers and autoimmune diseases. At present vitamin D deficiency is common worldwide. In the UK this condition frequently affects people especially in winter when vitamin D synthesis induced by the sun is zero. Solar ultraviolet (UV) exposure is the major source of vitamin D and as much as 90% of all vitamin D has to be formed in the skin. Narrowband UVB (NB-UVB) is a safe and effective method of stimulating vitamin D production, and it is impossible to overdose. This is the first study of short burst, limited exposure to forearms and face at home using a portable lamp. In most patients oral vitamin D supplementation is well tolerated and effective, but there is a minority who will not tolerate or absorb oral vitamin D. In the proposed study we will examine whether a seven day course of NB-UVB to hands and face improves vitamin D balance in winter in healthy volunteers and patients with vitamin D insufficiency, and whether this approach might be feasible, tolerated and acceptable to patients. In later studies we intend to assess if the technique can be used in nursing homes, in Crohn's disease and other causes of malabsorption and other chronic diseases which restrict sunlight exposure.",Patients and healthy volunteers with vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency (25OHD3 < 50nmol/L) will be recruited between November and April 2016/7 - Skin type II and III - No more than 400IU (10mg) vitamin D supplementation during the two preceding months. - Willing and able to provide written informed consent - Able to understand/communicate in English
4,"Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases",Obesity and other hyperalimentation,What is the impact of a modified Roux-en-Y-gastric bypass operation on people with type 2 diabetes mellitus? The LONG LIMB-2 double-blinded randomised controlled clinical trial,"The profound improvement in glucose control after Roux-en-Y-gastric bypass (RYGB) has led to the recognition of the intestine as a major player in glucose regulation. The optimal length of each of the three limbs (alimentary, biliopancreatic and common) remains controversial. This is further complicated by the differences in total small intestinal length in humans (ranging between 3.5-10.5 meters). Anatamical arrangements of RYGB results in three segments or ""limbs"": 1. ""Alimentary limb"" through which food enters the small intestine through a gastric pouch (the remnant of the stomach) 2. ""Biliopancreatic limb"" which includes the bypassed segments of the duodenum (first section of the small intestine) and proximal jejunum (second section) through which the biliopancreatic (bile acids from the gall bladder and pancreatic) secretions flow and 3. ""Common limb"" in which the food and biliopancreatic secretions mix. Current evidence supports the hypothesis that a ""modified"" RYGB with a long alimentary limb and short common limb may optimize glucose control. There have not been any clinical trials comparing ""modified"" and ""standard"" RYGB with glucose control as primary outcome. In this study, we propose to recruit 80 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and obesity who are eligible for metabolic surgery and currently on the waiting list for bariatric surgery at Imperial College London Healthcare NHS Trust obesity service. Randomisation will take place intra-operatively in patients with a total small intestinal length < 5.5 meters. The surgeon will contact the randomiser who will make the allocation to either ""modified"" or ""standard"" RYGB before continuing with the surgery. Research will take place at Imperial College London NHS Trust. Participants will attend 5 visits in total (baseline, day 10, 3, 6 and 12 months post operatively) for anthropometric measurements, blood tests, urine pregnancy test, assessment of number of glucose lowering medications and adverse event profile.",â¢ Diagnosis of T2DM â¢ BMI > 30 kg/m2 â¢ Age 18-65 years â¢ Eligible for metabolic/bariatric surgery as per NICE CG189
7,Diseases of the eye and adnexa,Visual disturbances and blindness,"Binocular vision, visual function and pupil dynamics in people living with dementia: Exploring their relationships to rate of cognitive decline and structural changes within the brain","Some types of memory problems can change your ability to judge distances. This is called depth perception. It can be measured with some simple and easy tests, which are used in hospitals all the time. Problems with depth perception can lead to double vision, headaches and sore eyes. These problems can also increase risk of falling, make hand-eye tasks harder, and cause distress. Right now, testing depth perception is not included in current dementia-friendly eyetest guidelines. We donât know how common depth perception problems are amongst people with dementia, or whether they interact with other eye-related markers of dementia, like changes in the pupil (the black middle part of the eye), or letter chart vision. We also donât know if changes in these things over time match up with changes in memory test scores, sleep quality, or the visual areas of the brain on scans. We want to test up to 210 people with a recent dementia diagnosis (within last 18 months), who attend Surrey and Borders Partnership community clinics. They'll complete a sleep questionnaire and some eye tests three times over an 8 month period to see if their depth perception, letter chart vision and pupil functions change in this time, and whether these relate to any changes in memory test scores or sleep quality. For 30 people with Alzheimerâs Disease, we will invite them to have a brain scan (magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) and wear a sleep-tracker after the first and final visit. This sees if changes in their test results relate to changes in visual areas of the brain. If we find these simple, non-invasive tests of eyesight can predict dementia progression, including depth perception testing within dementia-friendly eyetests would be helpful. Eye testing could present an alternative way of monitoring progression of dementia.","All participants (maximum n = 210): â¢ Confirmed diagnosis, within last 18 months, of Alzheimerâs disease, vascular dementia, mixed Alzheimerâs/vascular dementia, Lewy Body dementia or posterior cortical atrophy. â¢ Attending community mental health (CMH) clinics at Surrey and Borders Partnership (SABP) NHS sites â¢ Baseline corrected visual acuity < = 0.300 logMAR bilaterally â i.e. no visual impairment1 â¢ No pathology affecting pupil function, e.g. ocular trauma â¢ No history of childhood amblyopia/strabismus â¢ No history of alcohol/substance misuse â¢ No significant neurological/psychiatric history excluding dementia, e.g. focal brain lesion, schizophrenia â¢ Not currently taking miotic/mydriatic medications (e.g. for glaucoma) â¢ Not currently taking medication likely to significantly impair cognitive function (e.g. sedatives, antipsychotics) â¢ Spectacles, if worn, are up-to-date prescription (within last 2 years) â¢ Fundus and media check within last 12 months, permitted diagnoses: no apparent defect, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, cataract (if not met, to be arranged prior to first study visit with The Outside Clinic or other provider of patientâs choice, costs reimbursed) Subset of PWD receiving MRI (n=30, comprising suitable sub-sample for pilot study13): â¢ Capacity to give informed consent at baseline scan, as determined by 3-Item capacity questionnaire (this criterion is in place for this subset of participants due to the requirement for the person with dementia to be alone in the scanner room during the scan and only able to be addressed by intercom). â¢ No contra-indications for MRI e.g. embedded metals, history of significant claustrophobia or previous panic or claustrophobia while in an MRI scanner â¢ Confirmed diagnosis, within last 18 months, of Alzheimerâs disease â dementia type selected for established structural MRI disease progression markers"
10,Diseases of the respiratory system,Chronic lower respiratory diseases,Assessment of the asthma specific emotional profile in individuals with asthma and their partners,"Asthma is a disease with a variety of causes, severity and response to treatment. There is research evidence that patients whose asthma is less well controlled suffer higher levels of anxiety and depression compared to healthy people. Research has also shown that individuals with asthma who suffer from psychological distress have worse asthma and poorer self-management. Interventions addressing these psychological disorders have, however, not led to improved asthma control. One possible reason is that increased anxiety and depression arise due to a range of differing emotions. As such, it is important to understand what 'basic emotions' are present in relationship to asthma, such as fear, disgust, sadness or anger and whether these differ from patient to patient. It is also important to understand how they change, through assessing whether there is difference between these emotions and/or their intensity when the asthma is stable and when it flares up. Informal carers of chronically ill patients have also been shown to have increased levels of psychological disorders. Patients and partners can be looked at as one functional unit, so called 'dyad' where one partner's well-being impacts on the other's and vica versa. Therefore it is also important to understand the partners' psychological processes similarly to that of the patients. This study will use questionnaires to identify participantsâ asthma specific emotions and measure their intensities together with levels of anxiety and depression and perceived asthma control. Participants will be asked to complete two sets of questionnaires , one when the asthmatic partner is in stable condition and one when the disease worsens. Patients and partners will be asked to complete the questionnaires independently in their own homes and return them to the researchers by freepost. Returning the completed questionnaires will imply consenting to the study.",Patients with asthma or partners of individuals living with asthma Minimum 18 years of age
1,Certain infectious and parasitic diseases,Intestinal infectious diseases,"Combatting Bacterial Resistance in Europe â Clostridium difficile Infections (COMBACTE-CDI), understanding the burden of disease","Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most common cause of antibiotic associated diarrhoea in the western world. The infection causes significant diarrhoea, which in some cases can be serious and lead to secondary complications and even death. The infection is particularly an issue in elderly, frail patient, who are often already burdened with several other medical issues. Recent work has demonstrated that numerous cases are missed, either due to inadequate diagnostic tests or lack of clinical suspicion. The public-private partnership in COMBACTE-CDI will quantify the burden of CDI via a large, complex, multi-centre, multi-country study, and describe current management practices. An increased understanding of the CDI burden across Europe and better understanding of transmission of the organism will provide a basis for the further development of public health interventions and practices. Based on a previous successful study model (EUCLID), hospitals/laboratories of interest which carry out diagnostic testing of samples from both in-patients and community patients (including Long-Term Care Facilities patients) will be approached for inclusion in the study. Samples sent to the sites on the selected study date (regardless of test requested) will be tested at a central laboratory for CDI to look for missed cases of CDI. A follow up case/control study will collect data on outcomes and risk factors. Data will be used to construct transmission models and cost effective-ness models. Ultimately, a best practice model for CDI management will be developed.",Sample study ALL unformed faecal samples (takes the shape of the container and/or stick will not remain vertical when inserted into the sample) from ALL patients (ALL ages) sent to the microbiology department of participating sites on their allotted testing day (irrespective of test requested).

2,Neoplasms,Malignant neoplasms of digestive organs,Improving patient experience and outcomes in bowel cancer screening.,"Bowel cancer is the second most deadly cancer in the UK, killing on average 16,000 people each year. Cancer occurs as a result of changes, or âmutationsâ, in the DNA within cells. Currently, if a patient undergoes a biopsy or if the whole tumour is surgically removed (resection), this tissue can be tested for the presence of mutations. Tumours release tiny amounts of DNA and cells into the blood and stool, which can also be tested for the presence of mutations. Being able to detect these mutations will improve our ability to screen for the presence of cancer, provide information about a patientâs diagnosis and determine which treatment options are best for each patient. We have the opportunity to collaborate with two industrial partners to improve both the isolation of cancer cells from blood and stool samples and also the screening of these cells for the presence of mutations. Mikro Biyo have developed a novel technology which separates out circulating tumour cells (CTCs) and potentially circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) from patient blood samples. The benefits of this technique are the sensitivity and also the speed with which the blood can be processed. Genefirst have developed âATOM-seqâ, a super-sensitive technology, allowing the processing and sequencing of tiny amounts of the tumour DNA from patient blood and stool samples, to identify mutations. This novel technology could be implemented downstream of the CTC and ctDNA isolation, thus complementing the Mikro Biyo technology. We wish to obtain surplus tumour tissue, blood samples and stool samples from patients with bowel cancer, to compare the mutation profile of each sample type. We also wish to obtain stool samples from patients who have undergone a colonoscopy, to determine whether âATOM-seqâ could be used to further identify patients âat riskâ of cancer development.","All participants: - Aged between 18 and 115. - Able to give informed consent. - English literate (information sheet and consent forms will only be produced in English, due to financial constraints). For the 500 patients we would like to collect blood samples and a surplus tumour sample from: - Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of bowel cancer (ICD-10 code C18, C19 or C20). For the 1500 patients we would like to collect a stool sample and a surplus tissue sample from: - Patients who have undergone a colonoscopy, and have a known result."
4,"Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases",Metabolic disorders,Establishment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the airways of people with cystic fibrosis,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetically inherited disease requiring complex life-long medical treatment. People with CF have a shortened life expectancy. The median predicted survival in 2013 was 36.6 years. Although many organs in the body are affected, most morbidity and mortality is due to damage to the lungs caused by long-term bacterial infections requiring extensive treatment with antibiotics. Our previous work has demonstrated that the upper airways are important in the initial stages of bacterial infection. We believe that the upper respiratory tract in patients are key sites in which the bacteria adapts over time, before seeding down to establish in the lungs, and that nasal swabs could therefore be used for the earlier detection of bacterial pathogens. In addition, the use of new, portable sequencing technology (portable Nanopore sequencing) could significantly reduce the time to result from respiratory samples such as respiratory swabs and sputum samples, and permit analysis of sputum samples within the CF clinic, or potentially even at home, reducing the risk of Pseudomonas infection within the clinical environment. This combination of nasal swabbing as an early diagnostic tool and rapid sequencing for the identification of bacteria offers the potential for a prolonged and better targeted window for antibiotic therapy, leading to more successful eradication. The study would involve CF patients attending routine outpatient clinics or inpatients stays. From each patient a sputum sample/respiratory swab and a nasal swab would be taken at each attendance at clinic. The sample collection will be ongoing for up to 2.5 years although we envisage that most samples will be taken in the first year and all analysis will be completed within 5 years. This project could have real impact at a life-changing point in the long term disease management and outlook of CF patients.",Confirmed diagnosis of CF
6,Diseases of the nervous system,Other degenerative diseases of the nervous system,Investigating aspects of the eye and retina in people with Down's syndrome as potential biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease related change.,"People with Downâs syndrome (DS) have a very high prevalence for the early-onset of Alzheimerâs disease (AD). 100% of people show the neuropathological hallmarks of the disease in the brain and typically 40% of individuals are diagnosed with dementia by the fourth decade. It is well established that changes in the brain precede the clinical symptoms of AD by years or decades, identifying more precise markers of change will allow clinical trials to determine efficacy of therapeutics faster and more efficiently, greatly improving the process of Alzheimerâs drug research. Research in the retinas of patients with AD have shown marked decrease in retinal thinning in those with the disease, compared to healthy age-matched adults, and some research has suggested that retinal changes could precede those in the brain. Research from this group has identified a thicker retina in people with DS in comparison to age-matched controls, furthermore, typical age-related thinning patterns were not observed in the DS group. In order to establish the nature of these features in the DS retina, further investigations in the eye are proposed. People with DS have lifelong over-production of amyloid-beta (AÎ²), a protein highly implicated in AD. Part of the investigations in this study are to image AÎ² deposits in the retina. This Alzheimerâs Research UK funded study will use non-invasive retinal imaging methods to investigate retinal structure and features in an adult cohort of people with DS. This study will also provide longitudinal retinal thickness data in a subset of participants who have previously participated in studies with this research group.

2,Neoplasms,Malignant neoplasm of breast,Role of ABUS as an alternative to breast MRI in assessing response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy,"Some women who have been diagnosed with a breast cancer will require chemotherapy as part of their treatment. The chemotherapy can be given before breast surgery â neoadjuvant chemotherapy or after breast surgery â adjuvant chemotherapy. Whether chemotherapy is given before or after does not affect the clinical outcomes for the woman â ie there is no disadvantage to the woman. Due to the fact that giving chemotherapy before has no disadvantages, many of the oncologists like to give the chemotherapy before because they can see if the breast cancer is responding. They are able to do this by using imaging. The best imaging test is breast MRI. Ultrasound can be used but studies have shown that it is not as good. However, whole breast ultrasound (ABUS) provides 3dimensional information similar to breast MRI and the purpose of our study is to see if ABUS performs similar to breast MRI in being able to see if a tumour is responding to the chemotherapy. The breast MRI requires women to lie facing down and takes about 20mins. It involves an injection of contrast called gadolinium via a cannula. ABUS involves scanning the whole breast with the patient lying on their back and takes 10mins. There is no injection of contrast. MRI is an expensive test and often there is limited access to the scanner and so patients may have to wait for an appointment. ABUS because it is an automated process for obtaining the images can be performed in the breast unit in a timely manner without the issue of competing demands. All women who agree to take part in the study will have both the breast MRI - standard care and ABUS.",Inclusion criteria: 1.All female participants eligible for neoadjuvant chemotherapy and planning surgical treatment 2.

10,Diseases of the respiratory system,Acute upper respiratory infections,REspiratory Syncytial virus Consortium in EUrope (RESCEU) study: Defining the burden of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) disease.,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes severe respiratory disease in babies, the elderly and high-risk groups. In 2005 itâs estimated that RSV was associated with 3.4 million acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) hospitalisations and between 55,000 - 199,000 deaths in children under 5 years worldwide, most in developing countries. In the UK up to 1 in 25 of all children born each year are hospitalised due to RSV infection. Knowing the healthcare and societal costs associated with RSV infection are essential to decide which future treatments and preventatives to use. This study will determine the burden of RSV disease in at least 2000 healthy infants, to be recruited into one of two cohorts: 1. Passive (at least 1800): Demographic data will be collected at inclusion and a parental questionnaire at one year of age. Babies admitted to a hospital for an ARTI will be followed up to the age of 3 years. 2. Active (at least 200): At inclusion demographic data and the following samples will be taken; blood, a swab from the back of the nose, stool and urine samples from the nappy. During the RSV season (Oct to March) in first year of life, parents will be contacted weekly to monitor respiratory symptoms. If the infant has an ARTI they will be visited to test (by a nose swab) if the illness is due to RSV. If positive, samples as above will be taken and repeated 7 weeks later. There will be ongoing weekly contact enquiring of further ARTIs. Visits to determine if any respiratory illness is due to RSV continue throughout infantsâ first RSV season. Participants are followed annually by questionnaire.

2,Neoplasms,Malignant neoplasm of breast,Comprehensive Patient Records (CPR) for Cancer Outcomes: A feasibility study Workstream 5: Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs),"Comprehensive Patient Records (CPR) for Cancer Outcomes More people are living with and beyond a cancer diagnosis. The impact of cancer does not stop when treatment is over. There is limited understanding of the long-term effects of cancer and cancer treatment. The purpose of the main CPR study is to securely link information that is de-identified (has all identifiable markers such as name, address and date of birth removed) from electronic GP and community health records, to de-identified data from hospital records. This information will provide a broad picture of what happens to cancer patients across their cancer pathway and treatment. Ethical approval has been granted for the main study. CPR Workstream 5 PROMs (Patient Recorded Outcome Measures) are used for patients to record their own opinions about their health, treatment quality of life and other issues. PROMs are usually in the form of questionnaires. The objective of Workstream 5 is to measure cancer survivorsâ own perceptions of their health, quality of life and financial costs. Workstream 5 will take a smaller sample from the main studyâs population and collect PROMs directly from them. The PROMs survey will be sent to breast, colorectal and ovarian cancer survivors at around 5 years since diagnosis, and a sample of non-cancer controls for comparison. The survey can be completed online or by post. The selected PROMs will measure: finance, health, symptoms, psychological problems, navigating the healthcare system, relationships and barriers to exercise. The PROMs data will then be linked to de-identified data from patients' GP, community health and hospital records using the secure systems for data linkage approved for the main study.

5,Mental and behavioural disorders,Mood [affective] disorders,Physiological Studies to Investigate the Effects of Kisspeptin on Human Brain Processing.,"Psychosexual dysfunction affects 1 in 3 individuals, impairs quality of life and costs the NHS over Â£32 million/year. Current therapies have limited efficacy coupled with multiple side effects. Therefore, there is an unmet need to develop safer and more effective treatments through a deeper understanding of human sexual and emotional brain processing. The limbic system is an area of the brain known to control memories and emotions related to sexual desire and reproductive behaviours. The limbic system interacts with reproductive brain areas and sensory centres such as those related to smell. Kisspeptin is a hormone which is widely expressed in the human limbic system as well as brain areas that control reproduction and sensory inputs. Kisspeptin reduces sexual aversion and negative mood when given to healthy men with specific brain activity changes seen on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In animals, kisspeptin is closely linked to smell, sexual behaviours, mood and memory. This physiological study will investigate whether kisspeptin has similar effects on human brain processing using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants will be recruited into groups of healthy men and women, men and women with low mood and men and women with low sexual desire. Following a screening visit and obtaining informed consent, all participants will attend for two study visits each, during which they will undergo an fMRI scan while receiving either kisspeptin or placebo. During the scan participants will be presented with standardised tasks designed to activate sensory, emotional and reproductive brain pathways so that kisspeptinâs modulation of these pathways can be measured.",â¢ Aged 18 â 70 years â¢ Right handed â¢ Non-smoker â¢ Heterosexual orientation
21,Factors influencing health status and contact with health services,Persons with potential health hazards related to family and personal history and certain conditions influencing health status,Comparing Electrophysiological Brain Measurements of Electrode Function to Speech Perception in Adult Cochlear Implant Users,"For people with insufficient hearing to effectively use hearing aids, cochlear implants can provide great benefit, although they do not restore normal hearing. Cochlear implants stimulate the hearing nerve directly with electrical currents from a set of electrodes surgically implanted into the inner ear (cochlea). Although cochlear implants are a great success, a wide range in speech perception outcomes are observed. The aim of this programme of research is to reduce the variability in performance as well as increasing the levels of speech recognition achieved by all. We propose to achieve this by using a special objective measure to record brain activity in response to sound for cochlear implant users. This technique is called electro-encephalology (EEG) and is used routinely in clinical practice and involves wearing a special hat containing recording contacts to make the measurements. By understanding the relationship between these responses to different sounds and speech understanding it will help us understand how cochlear implant users are listening to different cues in speech and what aspects limit these abilities. These measures will ultimately allow us to observe the brain changes that take place once cochlear implants are switched on and also to guide cochlear implant fitting approaches. This research project explores preliminary measures and it is fulfils one objective in a larger programme of research funded by the Medical Research Council. In this phase of the research we will be looking at the brain responses in cochlear implant users to different types of sounds to understand what they tell us about how the electrodes are working on the cochlear implant. The electrodes sit along the length of the implanted part of the cochlear implant and they are responsible for sending sound information directly to the hearing nerve. These objective brain measurements will be compared to âbehaviouralâ discrimination tasks using the same stimuli so that we can ensure the objective measures are direct measures of a perceptual skill. In a behavioural task the listener responds to the sounds that they hear whereas in an objective task the listener just has to remain awake and does not need to make a response. We will compare both the objective and behavioural results to the speech perception scores of an individual and look at how adjusting the sounds affects perception when listening with electrodes that we consider to be âgoodâ compared to those that we consider to be âbadâ based on our objective and behavioural measures.","- - Adults (18 years or older) with a cochlear implant in one or both ears - No upper age limit - No gender or socio-economic criteria - Speakers of English because the speech test is in English - Post-lingual onset of deafness because we know that pre-lingual onset can result in poor behavioural scores that we believe a different intervention is appropriate for ( training) but this is not the focus of this stage of the research programme - BKB sentence score (routinely tested) in quiet between 20-80% to ensure that they are not 'star'(top) performers and they are not having major device problems - 6 months post implant activation to allow acclimatisation to their device - Implanted 2015 and after to ensure latest version of their cochlear implants - Implanted with either Cochlear or Advanced Bionics devices - Able to travel to the research site at the Cambridge Biomedical Research Campus, Herchel Smith building"
7,Diseases of the eye and adnexa,Disorders of vitreous body and globe,Early Vitrectomy and Intravitreal Antibiotics for post-operative exogenous eNdophthalmitis: A feasibility multicentre randomised controlled trial (EVIAN Study),"What is this study about? To assess the feasibility of doing a trial of the benefit of prompt surgery for a rare but blinding bacterial eye infection known as âendophthalmitisâ that can complicate any invasive eye procedure. Endophthalmitis causes rapid loss of vision and antibiotic injections into the eye (""intravitreal"") may not be sufficient to control the infection. 50% patients need surgery to remove the infected vitreous (vitrectomy) with patients requiring intensive and extended inpatient/outpatient management over a 6-month period. The impact on the well being of patients and their carers, both physically and psychologically, is immense often with severe pain and sight loss, which may or may not recover. How will this study help patients? Earlier surgery, by removing infected vitreous material at diagnosis, rather than after failure to respond to intravitreal antibiotics, may accelerate recovery from the infection. Early vitrectomy may improve vision recovery, patient well-being, reduce NHS and patient costs with less hospital visits,and assist in endeavours to reduce antibiotic usage. What will we do in this study? In order to measure the possible benefit of earlier surgery,we need to conduct a feasibility study of a multicentre randomised controlled trial to discover if the trial we are planning is possible in the reality of urgent care management of these people in current NHS environments.Participants will be randomly allocated to vitrectomy performed at an earlier stage of the condition,or later if needs be in accordance with standard care. What do our patients think about the study? We undertook a focus group with patients who had vitrectomy for endophthalmitis exploring their views and experiences.The consensus was the study was worthwhile.They advised us to approach study patients in an undisturbed environment with nursing support, giving them at least 48 hours to reflect on trial information plan patient advisory group meetings during the study to guide our research.",Inclusion Criteria: General Health: Patient over 18 years of age Patient has capacity to give informed consent Patient not previously been enrolled in this study in regard to fellow eye Diagnosis of postoperative endophthalmitis within 6 weeks of ocular surgery/procedure/injection Patient healthy and willing to undergo vitrectomy surgery Ophthalmic Criteria: Symptomatic visual loss attributable to postoperative endophthalmitis Best corrected Snellen VA worse than 35 ETDRS letters in the study eye Exogenous endophthalmitis
2,Neoplasms,Malignant neoplasm of breast,Technical development of Automated Low Dose Risk Assessment Mammography (ALDRAM) in women attending for annual mammography through a family history clinic,"Breast cancer (BC) is the commonest cause of death in young women. Breast screening in women aged 35-45, at increased risk due to their family history, has been shown to improve survival. However, 80% of women who develop BC do not have a family history. Numerous studies have shown that high mammographic density (MD) is one of the strongest risk factors for BC development. Full field digital mammography (FFDM) can be used to assess MD, however it is not recommended for population BC screening in those < 40 years of age due to the concerns about the use of ionising radiation. Safe and accurate high throughput methods to quantify MD in young women are thus required to improve risk prediction and reduce BC mortality. This study aims to develop a low dose mammogram, with quantification of density using artificial intelligence, to facilitate high throughput risk assessment in young women. 600 women aged 30-45, previously identified as being at increased risk of BC and attending for annual mammography at The Nightingale Centre will be recruited. Participants will undergo FFDM of the right breast as usual, however, following acquisition of the craniocaudal (CC) view, the breast will remain compressed and the mammogram dose reduced by 90% to deliver a LD mammogram. This process will be repeated for the right medio-lateral oblique (MLO) view. The left breast FFDM will proceed as normal. We estimate that each extra exposure will take 1-2 minutes only. We will use deep machine learning methods to define the relationship between standard FFDM views and their low dose counterparts and determine which view (CC vs MLO) provides the best correlation to be taken forward to the next stage of the research.","-Females with moderate to high risk of breast cancer, identified through and attending for annual review and mammography at the family history clinic, Nightingale Centre, Manchester -Current age 30-45 years -Capable of providing informed consent to a patient information sheet written in English"
4,"Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases",Diabetes mellitus,"A low-carbohydrate, low-energy dietary intervention for patients with type 2 diabetes in primary care: a feasibility study","Type 2 diabetes is a lifelong condition in which a personâs blood sugar levels are too high. It affects 1 in 16 people in the UK, and causes almost 15% of adult deaths worldwide. If it isnât controlled, it can lead to blindness, kidney failure, and heart disease. We know that what we eat affects our blood sugar levels, and that changing our diets and losing weight can both help to control diabetes. However, it is not clear what the best advice is to help people achieve this goal. Committed clinicians have shown that, in selected patients, low-carbohydrate, low-energy diets can transform the lives of people with type 2 diabetes, reducing the need for medications, improving quality of life and reducing costs for the NHS. However, we donât know whether this will work for everyone with diabetes, and whether this diet can be managed without intensive help from specialists. We aim to investigate whether it is possible for GPs and practice nurses to support people with type 2 diabetes to change their diet. First to reduce their energy intake to around 800 calories per day for 8 weeks (mostly by cutting out carbohydrates, found in foods like cakes and biscuits but also bread, pasta, rice and potatoes), and second to gradually increase their energy intake while still severely restricting the amount of carbohydrate. We will measure how well the advice is delivered and how successful people are in following the programme over a 3 month period. The findings from this early stage testing will help to refine the programme before we progress to a full-scale study, to investigate whether this diet can improve blood sugar control more effectively than the standard dietary advice for people with diabetes.","- Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the study. - Male or Female, aged 18 years or above. - BMI of > = 30kg/m2 - Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, as defined by an HbA1c > = 48mmol/mol, and who would consider (or prefer) using dietary means rather than increasing medications to improve diabetic control and their general health. - Patients must have undergone diabetic retinopathy screening within the last 12 months."
14,Diseases of the genitourinary system,Renal failure,Strategy for timely intervention of renal support in the ICU,"Critically ill patients who develop acute kidney injury (AKI) have high hospital mortality rates in excess of 50%, despite remarkable improvements in the overall intensive care treatment and the availability of new renal replacement therapy (RRT) methods. RRT is an essential component of modern critical care but the optimal time for starting RRT remains unknown. Furthermore, we do not have a reproducible approach for evaluating patients to decide who needs RRT in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. It is our hypothesis that there is a need for a dynamic risk-stratification tool to identify patients who will or won't need RRT for management of their AKI. In collaboration with a team in San Diego (US), we previously developed a clinical index based on routinely available clinical and laboratory parameters. The index represents the relationship between metabolic and fluid demands placed on the kidneys versus the capacity of the kidneys to handle the demand (i.e. Demand / Capacity index) In this feasibility project, we plan to validate this Demand / Capacity (D/C) index. We propose to demonstrate that sequential assessment of the D/C clinical index in high-risk patients can assist clinicians determining the optimal time for starting, withholding and stopping RRT. For this purpose, we plan to analyse sequential routinely available data of 100 high-risk patients and determine their daily D/C clinical index. After the patient has been discharged from the ICU, we present the D/C index together with the clinical data to the treating clinician and explore whether knowledge of the D/C index would have changed their decision to start, withhold or stop RRT.",â¢ Adult patients > = 18 years â¢ Potential ICU stay > 72 hours
10,Diseases of the respiratory system,Chronic lower respiratory diseases,Can Internet of Things (IoT) technologies enhance self-efficacy and self-management in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)? : an exploratory study,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a long-term lung condition estimated to affect over 1.2 million people in the UK. Death rates from COPD world-wide are increasing rapidly. Common symptoms include breathlessness, cough, fatigue and altered mood. The condition is managed by a combination of medication, exercise and patient education. Patients are offered a structured programme (Pulmonary rehabilitation PR), which focuses on education, exercise and self-management. Medication and PR are effective, if the principles and methods are sustained. However, air quality, temperature, inhaler technique and fear of worsening symptoms affect patient compliance and symptom experience. COPD has great potential to yield benefits from advanced technologies (e.g. mobile phone applications, âsmartâ devices and sensors to detect movement or environmental conditions), collectively known as âInternet of things (IoT) technologiesâ, but their application is currently limited. CityVerve (http://www.cityverve.org.uk/what-is-cityverve/) consists of a number of research projects, acting as âdemonstratorsâ for a range of IoT technologies, exploring the âadded valueâ of combining technologies.

22,Codes for special purposes,Provisional assignment of new diseases of uncertain etiology,COVIDTrach; a UK national cohort study of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheostomy,"When COVID-19 leads to a severe infection in the lung patients need to be placed on a ventilator. Clinical practice before the pandemic was for patients who were expected to be on the ventilator for over 7 days to undergo a tracheostomy, a surgical procedure to put a breathing tube through the neck into the windpipe. It is uncertain whether patients with COVID-19 also benefit from this operation due to the severity of their respiratory illness and high death rate. Furthermore, there is concern that opening the airway through the tracheostomy puts health care professionals performing the procedure at risk of being infected by the corona virus. COVIDTrach is collaborative project by surgeons and intensive care doctors that looks at the outcomes of ventilated COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheostomy and evaluates the use of personal protective equipment and rate of COVID-19 infection amongst operators.

10,"Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium",Delivery,Prostaglandin insert (Propess) versus tran-scervical balloon catheter for out-patient labour induction: A randomised controlled trial of feasibility (PROBIT-F),"Labour is a natural process, but sometimes it needs to be started artificially (Induction of labour). Currently, two methods of induction are used. The aim of this project is to compare how well these methods of labour induction work, which is the safest and least expensive method, and which is more acceptable to and favoured by women. The first method is PGE2 (synthetic prostaglandin), administered as a pessary (Propess) introduced in the vagina that delivers prostaglandin over 24 hours. The drug acts by softening the neck of the womb (cervix). Side effects include commencement of labour pains (contractions), which can sometimes be too frequent/strong and may be harmful to the baby and/or mother. The second less commonly used method is a catheter - a soft rubber tube with an inflatable balloon at the tip. The balloon is placed in the cervix, and softens it by causing the release of natural hormones (prostaglandins) produced by the woman's body. Excessive contractions have not been reported with catheter use. The catheter is an equally effective (but possibly safer and cheaper alternative to Propess) and is currently underutilised; and its use in the outpatient setting deserves further exploration. In this study, we want to find out if the balloon catheter is acceptable to women for labour induction as an out-patient, and furthermore whether women are willing to be allocated at random to Propess or the catheter, and explore their experiences. This data will help us to assess the feasibility and design of a larger future trial.","1.

This study will test a childâs steeping accuracy and body movement as they step onto targets with each leg. We will assess whether these measures are related to other clinical measures of Cerebral Palsy and whether they are reproducible between people and across time. Understanding a measures properties is important if we are to use them in trials and clinical practice. Twenty-five children with Cerebral Palsy will be asked to attend on two occasions. Each session will take up to 90 minutes to complete. Balance while stepping will be measured using a camera that monitors the movement of markers attached to the hips and feet and using a plate that can measure the forces generated while stepping. Children will be asked to step with either foot to targets in front of them or to the side. There will be 15 steps per target and rests will be provided as required. The stepping accuracy and movement of the body will be measured. On session 1 the test will be performed once. On session 2 the test will be repeated twice, once with the person running the test in session 1 and once with another researcher. In addition on session 1 we will measure childrenâs quality of movement while performing everyday tasks. In session 2 we will take measures of some common clinical problems such as leg strength, stiffness and range of motion. We will compare the results of the step test and clinical measures to 25 typically developing children of a similar age. We will see if the measures are reproducible and have any association with the clinical measures of quality of movement and clinical severity.","Children with cerebral palsy who can stand without holding onto equipment but may walk with crutches, sticks or frames- Gross Motor Function Classification levels 1-3.

5,Mental and behavioural disorders,Mood [affective] disorders,Assessment of the asthma specific emotional profile in individuals with asthma and their partners,"Asthma is a disease with a variety of causes, severity and response to treatment. There is research evidence that patients whose asthma is less well controlled suffer higher levels of anxiety and depression compared to healthy people. Research has also shown that individuals with asthma who suffer from psychological distress have worse asthma and poorer self-management. Interventions addressing these psychological disorders have, however, not led to improved asthma control. One possible reason is that increased anxiety and depression arise due to a range of differing emotions. As such, it is important to understand what 'basic emotions' are present in relationship to asthma, such as fear, disgust, sadness or anger and whether these differ from patient to patient. It is also important to understand how they change, through assessing whether there is difference between these emotions and/or their intensity when the asthma is stable and when it flares up. Informal carers of chronically ill patients have also been shown to have increased levels of psychological disorders. Patients and partners can be looked at as one functional unit, so called 'dyad' where one partner's well-being impacts on the other's and vica versa. Therefore it is also important to understand the partners' psychological processes similarly to that of the patients. This study will use questionnaires to identify participantsâ asthma specific emotions and measure their intensities together with levels of anxiety and depression and perceived asthma control. Participants will be asked to complete two sets of questionnaires , one when the asthmatic partner is in stable condition and one when the disease worsens. Patients and partners will be asked to complete the questionnaires independently in their own homes and return them to the researchers by freepost. Returning the completed questionnaires will imply consenting to the study.",Patients with asthma or partners of individuals living with asthma Minimum 18 years of age
2,Neoplasms,"Malignant neoplasms of ill-defined, secondary and unspecified sites",The effect of ketosis on FDG metabolism and PET-CT image quality in cancer,"2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) is a cancer imaging technique, which involves injecting a weakly radioactive form of glucose or 'sugar' known as fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) into the bloodstream. Cancer cells use glucose to generate energy and so accumulate large amounts of FDG, making them visible and readily detectable on PET images. However, normal cells use glucose for energy, making them also visible on PET images. This can sometimes make it difficult to identify where cancer cells are or where they have spread to, especially if some cancers demonstrate very little FDG uptake compared to nearby normal tissues or if cancer cells are located in organs which utilise large amounts of glucose, i.e. the brain. Ketones are natural substances produced by burning fat and represent an evolutionary response to sustain life in response to situations where carbohydrate (glucose) intake/stores are low, e.g. starvation. Ketones acts as fuels for energy but importantly are also able control the choice of fuel used by normal cells, by reducing the amount of glucose being burnt for energy. We believe that, by using a ketone drink to elevate circulating ketone levels in the bloodstream, equivalent to several daysâ worth of fasting (ketosis), it will reduce the number of normal cells utilising glucose and in turn lead to fewer normal cells being visible on the PET images, thereby beneficially influencing image quality. 57 patients with proven cancer already undergoing a FDG PET-CT as part of their routine clinical management, will be invited to return the Kingâs College London & Guyâs and St. Thomasâ (KCL/GSTT) PET Centre, for an additional research FDG PET-CT scan, within 15 working days of their clinical study, which will only differ by the ingestion of a ketone drink prior to scanning.

5,Mental and behavioural disorders,"Organic, including symptomatic, mental disorders",Independent Living Support Functions for the Elderly (IN LIFE),"Independent Living Functions for the Elderly (IN-LIFE) is a 3 year multidisciplinary European project that is funded by Horizon 2020. IN LIFE aims to prolong and support independent living for people with dementia using ICT's. Sheffield is one of six pilot sites across Europe and is also the only UK site. Researchers have been focusing on the potential of technologies in promoting independence for people living with dementia, generally to assist with aspects of safety and security. It is only recently that the potential of technologies as an intervention to support communication, social interaction and leisure activity has been recognised. The Computer Interactive Reminiscence and Conversation Aid (CIRCA) is an innovatively designed interactive software application comprising generic digital media including video, music and photographs (Astell et al 2010).CIRCA is presented on a touch-screen computer that requires no previous knowledge or experience of ICT and is intuitive to use. Previous evaluations of CIRCA have established a number of benefits for both the person living with dementia and those in a supporting role although these evaluations have been small scale and qualitative in nature. IN-LIFE is an opportunity to evaluate the CIRCA computer software with large quantities of people. The intervention consists of 4 phases overall and this application is concerned with phases 2 and 3. Phase 2 will recruit 120 people living with dementia and phase 3 60 people, from Sheffield Memory Services and GP practices. Potential participants will have received a recent diagnosis of dementia (within 12 months) and all those involved will participate from their own homes. Participation will involve a touch screen computer being installed in the persons home enabling interaction for 2 weeks. Measures will be taken before and after the intervention and again a 3 months post intervention.","A recent diagnosis of dementia from Sheffield Memory Services Has the capacity to provide informed written consent Living in their own home Adequate use of the English language Can participate as a dyad (alongside spouse, other family member or friend)"
17,"Congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities",Congenital malformations of the circulatory system,Prophylactic treatment of the ductus arteriosus in preterm infants by acetaminophen,"Treocapa is a Phase II/III European multicenter double-blind randomized trial, concerning prophylactic treatment with acetaminophen (paracetamol) for the first 5 days of life in extremely preterm infants. Premature birth is a significant cause of infant and child morbidity and mortality. Despite technological advances and efforts of child health experts during the last 20 years, the extremely premature infant remains at high risk for death and disability with 15-30% mortality and, in survivors, at least 20-30% risk of morbidity. The ductus arteriosus is open in all newborns at birth. Its constriction and closure are part of the normal process of postnatal adaptation. However, in many extremely preterm infants, the ductus arteriosus does not constrict itself. This defect of early constriction often persists and is a good predictor of subsequent development of patent symptomatic ductus arteriosus (PDA) which is associated with mortality and morbidity. The use of a medication that has an effect on ductus arteriosus with fewer adverse effects, i.e. acetaminophen, could be a safe alternative to current treatments. Thus, early prophylactic treatment of ductus arteriosus by acetaminophen among many neonatologists seems to be an opportunity to reduce mortality and morbidity Phase II is a dose finding phase in order to assess the minimum effective dose regimen (MEDR) of acetaminophen for the closure of PDA for neonates with a gestational age less than 27 weeks Phase III is a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled superiority trial, two arms in a 1:1 ratio. In the intervention arm, 20 mg/kg followed by 7.5 mg/kg quarter in die (QID) will be administered to the 27-28 weeks gestational age group (dosage confirmed through PK/PD data analysis from the previous Finnian study) and the dosage selected after the conclusion of the Phase II will be administered to the 23-26 weeks gestational age group.","Study population âª The study population of the Phase II is constituted of 30 preterm infants of 23-26 weeks of gestational age (10 patients in 23-24 weeks of gestational age, 10 patients in 25 weeks of gestational age and 10 patients in 26 weeks of gestational age). âª The study population of the Phase III, is constituted of 396 preterm infants of 23-26 weeks of gestational age and of 398 preterm infants of 27-28 weeks of gestational age Inclusion criteria âª Birth between 23-26 W for Phase II, between 23-28 W for Phase III âª Post natal age < 12 hours âª Parental or Legal Authority Consent âª Parents with a social security or health insurance (if applicable according to the local regulation)"
13,Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue,Arthrosis,Pilot Randomised Controlled Trial to determine the safety and early efficacy of the Direct Superior Approach in Total Hip Replacement,"Total hip replacement (THR) is routinely performed via a standard posterior or lateral approach. Indeed, 95% of the 90,000 THRs performed in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in 2016 were performed through standard posterior or lateral approaches. These approaches to the hip joint give excellent visualisation of hip anatomy; however, this comes at the cost of a relatively large incision and the sacrifice of some muscle and tendon. These drawbacks led surgeons to develop techniques to perform THR through smaller incisions, termed minimally invasive THR. Minimally invasive THR has been defined by an incision length of 12 cm or less. Proponents of minimally invasive THR believe the potential benefits to be a reduction in soft-tissue trauma, shorter intraoperative time, less perioperative blood loss, less postoperative pain, more rapid rehabilitation, earlier hospital discharge, and improved cosmetic appearance. Critics believe that the disadvantages include reduced operative visualization, a steep learning curve, an increased risk of neurovascular complications, a higher prevalence of dislocation, excessive skin trauma, and compromised implant fixation and positioning. One such minimally invasive approach is the direct superior approach. To investigate whether the direct superior approach is superior than the standard extended posterior approach in total hip replacement, a randomised controlled trial comparing the two is required. We plan to perform a pilot study, with 30 patients in total, with the aim of investigating whether a fully powered trial would be feasible.","â¢ Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the trial â¢ Male or Female, aged 18 to 85 years at recruitment into trial â¢ Diagnosed with hip OA, post-traumatic OA, inflammatory arthropathy, avascular necrosis, or congenital or developmental hip disease, avascular necrosis of the hip â¢ Listed for total hip arthroplasty at the study centre â¢ Female participants of child bearing potential must be willing to ensure that they use effective contraception during the trial â¢ Participant is fit to undergo total hip replacement based on consultant anaesthetist review â¢ In the Investigatorâs opinion, is able and willing to comply with all trial requirements â¢ Willing to allow his or her General Practitioner and consultant, if appropriate, to be notified of participation in the trial"
10,Diseases of the respiratory system,Other diseases of the respiratory system,Role of mathematically arterialised venous blood sampling in the assessment and management of adult subjects with respiratory failure; a prospective observational cohort study to investigate the physiological agreement between arterial sampling (the reference method) and mathematically arterialised venous blood sampling and the impact upon clinical decision-making and patient experience.,"Accurate assessment of gas exchange is essential to manage patients with acute and chronic respiratory failure (too high levels of CO2 in blood). Current guidance is to use arterial blood gas (ABG) sampling. However, clinicians are looking for other approaches as ABG sampling can cause complications including pain (frequent) and injury to the artery. Existing alternative methods include capillary blood gas (CBG) samples via earlobe puncture. In comparison to ABGs, CBGs are easier to obtain and usually less painful. However, they are less accurate. A newer method, v-TAC, is available. V-TAC combines measurements from venous blood (VBG) with oxygen saturation data collected from a pulse oximeter in a process of mathematical arterialisation. VBG sampling is easier and less painful than ABG sampling, but accuracy is limited without mathematical arterialisation. If this method is to be adopted we must ensure that the results obtained are reliable and robust enough to base clinical decisions on, especially for a population of patients with high in-hospital mortality. To date, no studies have evaluated whether calculated arterial values (v-TAC) provide a useful substitute to directly measured values in clinical decision-making. Therefore, we will assess patients with known or suspected chronic respiratory failure. We will obtain simultaneous blood gas samples obtained via arterial, capillary, and venous methods. Any impact on clinical decision making could be assessed by comparing the agreement of ABG, v-TAC, and CBG results against pre-defined clinical treatment thresholds; including the accuracy of detection of a minimally important clinical change in carbon dioxide levels and also the ability of v-TAC to identify clinically relevant treatment thresholds. The primary measure will focus on the comparison of v-TAC to ABG, the existing gold standard.

5,Mental and behavioural disorders,"Neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders","Patientsâ and Practitionersâ views on detecting, diagnosing and managing Anxiety Disorders in Primary Care","Anxiety disorders are a common mental disorder seen in primary care. It has been suggested that there has been a 40% increase in generalised anxiety disorder in the general population between 2007 and 2014. Whilst GP recording of anxiety symptoms has also increased, GP recording of anxiety disorders has decreased between 1998 to 2008. It is not clear why there is a disparity between the increase seen in the general population and estimates based on GP recordings of anxiety disorders, but it may be due to a reluctance by GPs to label patients with an anxiety disorder. In addition, anxiety and depression frequently co-occur, and there may be a tendency by GPs to prioritise recording depression over anxiety, potentially as a result of the 2014 Quality and Outcomeâs Framework. However, little is known about how GPs view the labelling and recording of anxiety, and their experience of discussing symptoms of anxiety or anxiety disorders with patients. Moreover, research suggests that patients may feel reluctant to seek help because they think that GPs may see symptoms as âtrivial, or there is a lack of encouragement by GPs to disclose psychological problems. Yet to date, no study in the UK has asked patients specifically about their views and experiences of seeking help for anxiety. The aim of this study is to interview patients, GPs, and clinicians who provide therapy to those with anxiety disorders, to understand how they view and experience the identification, diagnosis and management of anxiety disorders. Around 15 GPs, 20 patients, and 15 therapists will be interviewed. The interviews will be audio-recorded, fully transcribed and analysed so that the views practitioners and patients hold towards specific issues can be summarised and highlighted. By understanding more about these issues, we aim to improve patient care and outcomes for this group.","The study will entail conducting interviews with three groups: GPs, Patients and IAPT therapists.

Pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure and protein in urine) affects 2-7% of pregnant women and is potentially life-threatening to mother and baby. Both are also more likely to develop heart disease later in life. Outside pregnancy, high salt intake causes an increase in blood pressure. However our initial studies have shown that healthy women, early in pregnancy, have lowered blood pressure in response to salt. This agrees with earlier clinical studies, which indicated that the reduction of salt intake did not improve development of pre-eclampsia. My research, therefore aims to look at salt intake, in both healthy pregnancies and in women who develop pre-eclampsia. I will also study whether salt-sensing is altered, leading to a loss of salt from the body, resulting in high blood pressure and pre-eclampsia. We hope to use the results from this research to see if higher intakes of salt in pregnancy can reduce the chances of developing pre-eclampsia. We hope to find out more on how blood vessels work and whether extra salt can improve the chances of a healthy pregnancy and normal development of the placenta. We will also see if salt reduces the chances of women developing pre-eclampsia and, if it does, to understand how it does so. If we know more about these dietary-related changes, we may be able to advise at-risk women to take salt supplements to reduce their chances of developing pre-eclampsia, which may help prevent problems such as heart disease when the mother and baby are older","Pregnant women at term: â¢ Pregnant women, aged between 18 years of age and 45 years of age inclusive, who are either normotensive (for control tissue), or with GH, PE, with or without IUGR or IUGR alone or PTB.

These abnormalities in arterial stiffness could be driven by the risk factors for those conditions (e.g. cigarette smoke, obesity). Neuromuscular disease also causes hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia, without these risk factors. Thus the opportunity exists to determine whether hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia alone cause arterial stiffness. We hypothesized that arterial stiffness is increased in motor neurone disease patients with hypoxaemia including respiratory failure compared to those without and that non invasive ventilation has an effect on arterial stiffness in these patients. The study aims to compare the arterial stiffness in motor neuron disease patients with hypoxaemia and/or hypercapnia with those without.

In children below 20kg of weight, enalapril is widely used offÂ¬label on the basis of a few clinical studies. Its safety and efficacy is well understood, especially in the older population and is regarded as gold standard therapy in heart failure. Enalapril is currently available only in the form of tablets in the European Union. Although oral liquids from crushed tablets are commonly used for infants and young children, they are less portable than solids. Also, due to problems when the drug is dissolved, solid oral paediatric dosage forms are needed. Within the LENA project, the new dosage form of so called orodispersible minitablets (ODMTs) will be used as a vehicle for enalapril. ODMTs are small sized tablets (2mm in diameter) which immediately disintegrate in the mouth. Hence, accidental particle inhalation or in the worst case aspiration pneumonia can be prevented. This study will involve children from birth up to 6 years of age, all of whom have heart failure due to congenital heart disease. The children will be seen and treated at the hospital where their routine clinical care already takes place.

These impairments have been shown to have detrimental effects on childrenâs social development and mental health, and are associated with rejection and bullying by peers, school exclusion and mental health problems.

6,Diseases of the nervous system,Other disorders of the nervous system,Deep Learning for Identification of Abnormalities on Head MRI,"Unexpected abnormalities with potential clinical relevance (incidental findings) occur in 2.7% of head MRI studies. There is a wide variation in how incidental findings (IFs) discovered in âhealthy volunteersâ are managed. Routine reporting of âhealthy volunteersâ by a radiologist is a challenging logistic and financial burden and in a survey of UK institutions performing research imaging, just 14% of institutions had this as policy. It would be valuable to devise automated strategies to ensure that IFs could be reliably and accurately identified which potentially would remove 90% of scans requiring routine radiological review, thereby increasing the feasibility of implementing a routine reporting strategy. Deep learning is a new technique in computer science that automatically learns hierarchies of relevant features directly from the raw inputs (e.g. MRI) using multilayered neural networks. Previous studies have demonstrated the potential of deep learning methods in the basic interpretation of neuroradiological studies including MRI scans. We will train a deep learning algorithm on a large database of head MRI studies to recognise studies with abnormalities. The Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences (King's College London) has acquired and stored more than 20,000 head MRI studies which are available for research purposes.

In response to research showing that the care needs of adolescents and young adults with cancer are poorly met, there has been a rapid expansion in the availability of dedicated services for teenagers and young adults (TYA; aged 15 to 24 years at diagnosis) in the United Kingdom. However, no age-specific care services are available for young adult cancer patients aged 25 to 39 years at cancer diagnosis, while this patient group also faces age-specific issues that can negatively impact health-related quality of life. The current patient care for young adults with cancer may be compromised by the lack of insight into the young adult cancer patient journey and probably inadequate care infrastructure (e.g. resource availability, lack of expertise). What are our aims? To be able to develop age-specific supportive care services for young adults with cancer, this study aims to provide insight into the young adult cancer care experience, the (unmet) supportive care needs, impact of cancer on young adultsâ lives, and preferences for and expectations of age-specific cancer care. How will we do this? This study has a mixed method design. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups will be conducted with young adult cancer patients, their health care professionals and informal caregivers about the preferences and expectations of age-specific care. A survey will be administered to all alive young adult cancer patients diagnosed with cancer aged 25-39 years in the Royal Marsden Hospital in the past five years. The survey measures care experiences, supportive care needs, health-related quality of life, psychological distress, impact of cancer, illness cognitions and self-management. What can we learn?

15,"Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium",Complications of labour and delivery,Prediction of Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes Following Induction of Labour,"Induction of labour (IOL) is one of the most common obstetric procedures and is carried out in 20-30% of pregnancies. More than a third of women having IOL will need either an instrumental delivery or a caesarean section. Currently, the Bishop score, based on findings of vaginal examination, is the most commonly used clinical assessment prior to IOL. Unfortunately, it is subjective and unreliable and its utility at predicting successful vaginal delivery is limited. A model that could accurately predict which women will have a successful induction of labour would be of significant benefit in counselling women prior to induction. We propose to develop a model that will accurately predict the time from induction to delivery and the risk of caesarean section using a combination of maternal and fetal factors measured at a pre-induction clinic. The biochemical factors measured will include fetal fibronectin and placental alpha-macroglobulin-1, both markers of preterm delivery that have not been robustly studied in an induction of labour context. We will also systematically measure throughout labour three recently described ultrasound parameters (angle of progression, head-perineum distance, sonographic cervical dilatation) in women undergoing induction in order to assess their utility in predicting operative delivery.",1.

When this occurs a peripheral neuropathy can occur when the nerves carrying sensory information are affected. People with diabetic peripheral neuropathy have a high risk of foot ulceration and amputation which affects function and associated with high NHS and social care costs. People with diabetes can also have reduced movement at joints caused by increased stiffness in connective tissue. Reductions in ankle and big toe movement leads to increases in the pressure over the sole on the front part of the foot (the forefoot) when walking; this is a risk factor for ulceration. The study will to assess whether ankle and big toe joint mobilisations and home program of stretches in people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy improves joint range of motion and reduces forefoot peak pressures. Fifty eight people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy and a moderate risk of plantar ulceration will be recruited from a local podiatry clinic. They will be randomly assigned to an intervention (29 people) or control group (29 people). We will control for between-group differences in age using a minimization process. The intervention will consist of a 6 week program of ankle and big toe joint mobilisation by a physiotherapist and home stretches. The control group will consist of usual care including podiatry interventions. Outcome measures will be taken at baseline, post intervention and at 3 month follow up by an assessor who does not know the group allocation. Primary outcome will be ankle range while walking with secondary outcomes including big toe joint range, forefoot pressure while walking and balance. Changes over time between the groups will be compared statistically and the relationship between ankle range of motion and peak plantar pressure will be analysed using linear regression.","a)Diagnosis of type I or II diabetes with a moderate risk of foot ulceration as defined by i.Detection in less than < 8/10 sites on the plantar aspect of the foot using a 10 g monofilament ii.Foot deformity defined and graded using a foot deformity score previously developed for people with diabetes b)Peripheral Neuropathy- This is defined according to NICE CG19 guidelines.

2,Neoplasms,Malignant neoplasms of female genital organs,Muscle wAsting in Major Abdominal Surgery (MAMAS II Study),"Following major surgery, the functional capacity of patients is affected. This is due to muscle wasting and weakness. Recovery after surgery can take more than a year especially in frail and elderly patients. We have previously carried out a study (MAMAS study), which showed patients that undergo elective major abdominal surgery for liver/pancreas/gallbladder/bile ducts and women reproductive tract cancer lose 10 % of their muscle size and undergo a similar decrease in muscle strength within a week of surgery. However more frequent measure of muscle size and strength post-surgery is needed to find out the lowest point of muscle loss and weakness and when the recovery starts. In this study we will enrol 24 patients having elective major abdominal surgery for liver/pancreas/gallbladder/bile ducts and women reproductive tract cancer. We will measure breathing and thigh muscle size using ultrasound scan and carry out hand grip strength and sniff test (to assess breathing muscle strength) before the surgery, day 1 post-surgery, and thereafter on alternate days until hospital discharge and at 6 weeks after the discharge. In addition, we will also carry out simple physical function tests and questionnaires before and 6 weeks after surgery. Small amount (~45 mg) of abdominal muscle biopsy tissue will be collected during the surgery (optional) and bloods sample at four time points (pre-op, day 1 post-surgery, day 7 post-surgery/hospital discharge and 6 weeks after discharge) during the study participation. The outcome of this study will allow to design future interventional studies to reduce the muscle loss and weakness post-surgery. This could lead to improve recovery rate following major abdominal surgery, shorter stay in hospital and fewer post-operative complications and readmission.",1. Age > = 18 years 2.

1,Certain infectious and parasitic diseases,Other bacterial diseases,External pilot study to inform the design and conduct of the Fluids in Shock (FiSh) Trial,"Children are now much more likely to survive a severe infection than ever before. This progress comes from a whole package of treatments including antibiotics, multiple rapid doses (boluses) of fluid (e.g. saline solution) into a childâs veins (âfluid bolus therapyâ) and support for breathing and heart function. We hope to improve the outcome of children with severe infection by refining one part of this package: by exploring what is the best amount of fluid to give in the earliest stages of treatment. We are designing a clinical trial (called Fluids in Shock â FiSh) to find out whether giving less fluid per bolus to children with symptoms of a severe infection (septic shock) is better than giving a higher amount of fluid, as currently recommended. We are conducting a pilot trial, a smaller version of the trial we would like to run. We will recruit 108 children admitted with septic shock to emergency departments in 14 NHS hospitals over nine months. Patients will be randomly allocated to receive either fluid boluses of 10 ml/kg (intervention) or 20 ml/kg (usual care) every 15 minutes for up to four hours. We would also like to ask parents/legal representatives who do and do not give consent to the study their views on the consenting process. Questionnaires (100-150) and telephone interviews (15-25) will be used to explore the parents/legal representativesâ acceptability of the study, including the approach to recruitment, consenting procedures and participant information materials. We will also hold three focus groups with the hospital research teams to explore their experiences of screening, recruiting, randomising and consenting parents/legal representatives to the pilot trial. By doing this study, we hope to find out whether the trial is possible and, if so, how it should be done.","Pilot RCT â¢ Age greater than or equal to 37 weeks (corrected gestational age) and less than 16 years â¢ Clinical suspicion of infection â¢ Clinical signs of shock after receipt of 20 ml/kg of bolus fluid â¢ Recruitment and randomisation to take place while child is in an acute assessment area (e.g. ED, paediatric assessment unit (PAU)) Parent/Legal representative questionnaires and interviews â¢ Parents/Legal representatives who do and do not consent to the pilot RCT Site research staff focus groups and interviews â¢ Site research staff who are involved in screening, recruiting, randomising and consenting parents/legal representatives during the pilot RCT"
14,Diseases of the genitourinary system,Renal failure,What factors explain the association between socioeconomic deprivation and a reduced likelihood of living-donor kidney transplantation? A questionnaire based case-control study.,"A living-donor kidney transplant (LDKT) describes a kidney transplant in which a kidney is donated by a living friend or family member and transplanted into someone with kidney failure. A LDKT is the best treatment for most people with kidney failure. Socioeconomically deprived people in the UK are more likely to develop kidney failure, but less likely to receive a LDKT. This study aims to investigate whether socioeconomic position is related to a kidney patientâs i) transplant knowledge and beliefs, ii) level of involvement in managing their own healthcare, and iii) support and offers of donation from friends and family. The study will determine whether these potentially modifiable factors explain why more deprived patients are less likely to receive a LDKT, and identify targets for intervention.",We aim to collect responses from approximately 930 living-donor kidney transplant (LDKT) recipients (cases) and 930 deceased-donor kidney transplant (DDKT) recipients (controls) from all adults (age> 18) transplanted at the ten UK study sites between 1/4/2013 and 31/3/17.

Participants infected with HCV, without liver cirrhosis (when normal liver tissue is damaged and replaced by scar tissue), received 8 weeks of the combination drug. The treatment was shown to be safe and effective, curing almost 99% of people infected with HCV without cirrhosis regardless of their HCV strain (genotype). There was no need for ribavirin, which is an antiviral drug with serious side effects that is given in combination with other drugs used to treat HCV. Glecaprevir (300mg)/pibrentasvir (120mg) had no specific toxicity or side effects of treatment. Due to this factor, and because no ribavirin is required, there is no need for monitoring of full blood count or liver function. The combination can be safely administered without regular monitoring of blood levels; as is the standard of care treatment for drugs used to treat HCV currently. The aim of this study is to determine if on-treatment monitoring can be simplified for chronic HCV patients without cirrhosis receiving glecaprevir (300mg)/pibrentasvir (120mg) for 8 weeks. One post treatment visit will be conducted 12 weeks after the final dose of study medication to evaluate the proportion of patients with undetectable HCV RNA at this timepoint (SVR12).","1) Have voluntarily signed the informed consent form. 2) 18 years of age or older. 3) Chronic HCV infection as defined by anti-HCV antibody or HCV RNA detection for greater than 6 months. 4) HCV RNA plasma > = 10,000 IU/ml at screening. 5) HCV genotype 1-6. 6) HCV treatment naÃ¯ve (no prior treatment with an approved or investigation anti-HCV medication). 7) Stage F0-3, based on: hepatic elastography < 12.5 kPa on FibroscanÂ® or APRI < 1.0. 8) If co-infection with HIV is documented, the subject must meet the following criteria: - ART naÃ¯ve with CD4 T cell count > 500 cells/mm3; OR - On a stable ART regimen for > 8 weeks prior to screening visit, with CD4 T cell count > 200 cells/mm3 and a plasma HIV RNA level below the limit of detection. 9) Negative pregnancy test at screening and baseline (females of childbearing potential only). 10) All fertile females must be using effective contraception during treatment and during the 30 days after treatment end."

To prevent this, mechanically-ventilated patients in the ICU are frequently given stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) in the form of one of two types of medicine: proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or histamine-2 receptor blockers (H2RBs). Despite SUP being administered to millions of ICU patients worldwide, it is unclear where PPIs or H2RBs are preferable and current usage is dependent on clinician preference or unit policy rather than empirical evidence. The PEPTIC study will compare the two approaches to SUP treatment regimens to determine which leads to the best outcomes for patients. The study is being conducted in New Zealand, Australia, Ireland and England. Data will be collected on patients admitted to ICUs requiring mechanical ventilation where SUP is considered clinically appropriate. Data required for the study is already routinely recorded in ICUs â in England, this will be collected through the ICNARC Case Mix Programme (CMP).",- Aged 18 years and above - Admitted to a participating ICU - Invasively mechanically ventilated within the first 24 hours of a ICU admission

The trial population are those who have had symptoms for at least six weeks despite conservative management such as physiotherapy and pain relief. A total of 252 participants will be recruited, and randomised to receive one of two types of operation. One type of operation is posterior cervical foraminotomy (PCF), which involves operating through the back of the neck. The other type of operation is anterior cervical discectomy (ACD), which involves operating through the front of the neck. Both of these operations are currently standard treatments for this condition. Potential participants will be identified in neurological centres in the UK following referral from their GP, they will be given a Patient Information Sheet and then informed consent will be taken if they would like to take part. Participants will then be registered to the study, and have assessments performed. Participants will complete questionnaires, then be randomised to a treatment arm on the day of their operation.

5,Mental and behavioural disorders,Unspecified mental disorder,"The Involvement of Family, Friends and Carers in Inpatient Mental Health Care: What Do Patients Want? Qualitative Interviews with Patients, Carers and Clinicians.","Studies have found that people using mental health services are more likely to stick to their treatment plans and have better outcomes when their supportive friends and family members (âcarersâ) are involved in their care. Most mental health guidelines and policies suggest that staff members should involve carers in patientsâ treatment. Despite this, carers frequently report feeling excluded from patientsâ care and from giving or receiving information about the patient. This is particularly a problem in hospital settings, when someone is admitted to an inpatient ward following a mental health crisis. The difficulties that carers can face are well documented in published research. There are also lots of studies discussing staff membersâ and researchersâ opinions about how best to involve carers. However, the thoughts and feelings of patients themselves have not really been explored in detail. As a result, there is almost nothing in the research literature which helps clinicians understand how patients want involvement to take place or which things might be important for them when making their decisions. In this study, qualitative interviews will be conducted with twenty patients, twenty carers and ten clinicians to better understand the needs of patients in inpatient settings. All participants will need to have current or recent (within the past five years) experience of being in inpatient settings. Each interview is expected to last 45-120 minutes. The interviews will be analysed using thematic analysis. The findings will be written up in a journal article, as well as being shared on social media. This study is being conducted as part of an NIHR-funded Doctoral Research Fellowship (DRF-2015-08-071) titled, âThe involvement of family and friends in inpatient mental health care: what do patients want?â.","Patients 1.

2,Neoplasms,Malignant neoplasms of digestive organs,Primary and Secondary Screening in individuals with Inherited Pancreatic Disease syndromes for Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and complications of other pancreatic diseases.,"Pancreatic cancer has one of the worst overall survival of malignancy (five year survival under 10%). The main reason for this is late detection. Symptoms are non- specific and screening of asymptomatic individuals is impractical as no current screening system has adequate specificity to avoid false positives exceeding true positives, treatment for pancreatic cancer involves surgical resection of the organ with very high associated morbidity and even mortality. In order to develop and validate improved screening modalities these need to be applied to high risk individuals. Current guidelines only allow research screening in individuals with an autosomal dominant predisposition for pancreatic cancer. The European Registry for heredity pancreatitis and familial pancreatic cancer (EUROPAC) was established in 1996 in order to identify individuals at high risk of pancreatic cancer. We wish to continue recruitment to this registry and to continue to pilot secondary screening for pancreatic cancer in the individuals registered. The registry has also proved an invaluable resource in order to study pancreatic diseases in general: diabetes, acute and chronic pancreatitis as well as cancer. We also wish to continue this analysis. The screening we propose to carry out will be based on established methods of pancreatic imaging including Endoluminal Ultrasound, Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging. This will be supplemented by use of biomarkers which will at first be purely experimental but following validation will be used to phase subsequent screening. Epidemiological and demographic data as well as clinical reports will be used to stratify cancer risk and to monitor disease progression: acute pancreatitis can progress to chronic pancreatitis with endocrine and exocrine failure; diabetes mellitus can be both an early sign of pancreatic cancer and also a risk factor.","Inclusion Criteria for Registry: Cancer families: Two first degree relatives with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. A family with three or more relatives with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

Pancreatitis families: Families with two or more relatives with idiopathic pancreatitis. Families with at least one case of pancreatitis and a confirmed causative mutation in the PRSS1 gene. Cyst surveillance: Individuals already enrolled on surveillance due to identification of a pancreatic cystic lesion NOD individuals: Individuals over the age of 40 with diabetes mellitus diagnosed in the last 6 months Disease control Individuals with: diagnosed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; acute or chronic pancreatitis of any aetiology; and individuals with long term (over two years) type 2 or 3c diabetes mellitus Inclusion Criteria for Screening: Individuals over 40 years of age from an established pancreatic cancer family where the family is consistent with predisposition with high penetrant autosomal dominant inheritance (for example, at least two first degree relatives with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where no non-penetrant carriers have to be assumed over the age of 75). Individuals with Peutz-Jeghers syndromes, or individuals with affected relatives under the age of 50 will be considered for inclusion below the age of 40. Unaffected members of a family with an associated cancer syndrome and at least one case of pancreatic cancer, who are over 40 years of age and who have been shown to carry the relevant genetic alteration. Any member of a Hereditary Pancreatitis (HP) family (autosomal dominant predisposition for pancreatitis) who have been confirmed to carry a causative PRSS1 mutation or (where no causative mutation is known) have symptoms of pancreatitis. Individuals incidentally found to have cystic lesions or other clinical features that indicate an increased risk of pancreatic cancer may also be included.

It is a high grade, aggressive B-cell lymphoma, and without treatment, survival is in the order of months. There are a number of standard treatments that are currently used in treating DLBCL, depending on the stage of the disease. Though the cancer often responds to these current treatments, there are instances where the cancer does not respond or where it returns. There is, therefore, a need to find alternative treatments that are more effective, leading to lasting responses. PLACARD study will investigate whether CXD101, a type of drug that blocks substances (enzymes) in the body called histone deacetylases and pembrolizumab, a type of immunotherapy designed to 're-awaken' the immune system, will improve response to treatment. There are 2 distinct stages to the study. The first stage of the study, called the safety run in stage, aims to find the highest tolerated dose of CXD101 which be given with the pembrolizumab. Up to 12 adult (aged > = 18 years) patients (3 patient cohort) with DLBCL, whose disease has either come back or not responded after 2 rounds of treatment will be recruited at this stage and given CXD101 and pembrolizumab. If there are no serious side effects, the second stage of the study, called the expansion stage, will recruit a further 33 patients. Patients will be seen regularly during treatment and then every 3 months until one year after treatment and then annually thereafter until the last patient entering the study completes their 1 year follow up.

The optical coherence tomography (OCT) scanner is a method of achieving this. It is similar to an ultrasound but uses light instead of sound and does not make contact with the tissue (in this case eye) being scanned. It is like having an eye scan at the airport.

Stage-1 aims to collect a range of views about injured adultsâ psychological needs and care to inform later development of a joint patient/practitioner workshop using participatory theatre to inspire changes in practice. This topic is important, we know that every year 5.8 million UK adults attend A&E following an accidental injury, 700,000 are admitted. More than 30% develop psychological problems (e.g. post-traumatic stress disorder) within 12 months. These delay and limit the extent of recovery and increase costs. Research emphasises the need to look after injured peoplesâ psychological wellbeing and provides evidence about the best ways to do it. However âThe Impact of Injuries studyâ showed that NHS injured adultsâ psychological care is generally poor. This is a good example of the limitations of research in improving practice and need for new ways to impart knowledge to effect change. Research suggests NHS practitioners need different sources of evidence and types of knowledge to provide effective care and manage the NHSâs complex demandsÍ¾ furthermore evidence suggests practitionerâs knowledge is largely learned through social not formal means. This explains why scientific evidence sometimes fails to make a difference in practice. So this study will combine different forms of knowledge, then represent it in a living performance to try and overcome these barriers. The project lasts for 3 years, earlier stages will help inform later ones, so we are currently applying for Stage-1 ethical approval only. Stage-1, lasting 1 year, aims to capture NHS patient, practitioner and research perspectives on injured adults psychological needs and care (and illustrative patient stories) using semi-structured interviews and focus groups.

All problems become more prominent as the disease progresses. The analysis of language change has led to particularly revealing insights, which may aid in the prediction of onset and prognosis of AD. Previous studies have found that analysing spoken language using a range of computational methods called Natural Language Processing (NLP) can distinguish individuals with AD from those without, very early on in the disease. Furthermore, analysis of writing can reveal changes in language apparent before other symptoms appear. We wish to build on this work, by investigating spoken discourse in patients recently diagnosed with probable AD, compared to cognitively intact ageing, over one-year. The aim is to identify components of speech, or âlinguistic factorsâ, which are sensitive to brain changes in AD. We will investigate novel techniques for collecting speech samples, in order to improve current methods used clinically and in research. Furthermore, we will investigate written language over one year, to analyse which linguistic factors are sensitive to change, and look at MRI scans to see where changes in the brain may relate to changes in language.","For patient cohort: 1.

1,Certain infectious and parasitic diseases,Other bacterial diseases,A phase III randomised controlled trial of continuous beta-lactam infusion compared with intermittent beta-lactam dosing in critically ill patients.,"Sepsis is the most common cause of death in critically ill patients, with a quarter of those developing severe sepsis during their hospitalisation. Even though the outcomes of patients with severe sepsis have improved, the number of patients with sepsis has increased. Currently there is no effective treatment for severe sepsis other than prompt administration of fluids, antibiotics and supportive care. These hospital acquired infections are recognised as an increasing public health problem causing more than a million deaths worldwide. It is already well established that administration of beta-lactam antibiotics is beneficial to patients with severe sepsis as these antibiotics treat the most common Gram +ve/-ve bacterial causes of infection. In animal and in vitro models it has been shown that continuous infusion of these antibiotics is superior to intermittent infusion, however human trials have been under-powered to provide significant evidence of this. This trial is aiming to determine whether giving a patient a continuous infusion of a beta lactam compared to an intermittent beta lactam infusion would affect patient outcomes and the vital status of patients at hospital discharge. The George Institute for Global Health is taking a stepwise program of research which to date has included a feasibility pilot randomised controlled trial (BLING I) and a phase IIb trial (BLING II), comparing continuous administration of beta-lactam antibiotics in ICU patients. BLING I had a sample size of 60 patients, BLING II had a sample size of 432 patients and looked at ICU free days at day 28. BLING III will be a definitive global trial to provide necessary evidence on whether there is a survival and economic benefit associated with continuous beta-lactam infusion in sepsis patients.",Eligible patients will be: 1. Those with a documented site of infection or strong suspicion of infection 2. Those that the treating physician believes will require treatment that extends beyond the next calendar day 3. Those that the treating physician has chosen to treat with piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem for this episode of infection 4. Those that the treating physician is uncertain whether the administration of a continuous or intermittent infusion would be better for the patient 5.

These symptoms are associated with lower quality of life and higher care costsÍ¾ increasing the cost of care for a person with dementia by around Â£30000 a year compared to a person with dementia without agitation symptoms. Our study team has developed a conceptual framework in which agitation experienced by people with dementia is strongly linked to lower quality of life and agitation is conceptualized as arising from, at least in part, a range of possible unmet needs. This includes external factors like staff being available, receptive, aware and skilled in providing accessible activities and physical and emotional comfort (including sensory) and the environment, such as other agitated residents. In severe dementia, unmet need may may manifest in more subtle or hidden agitation behaviours compared to walking without purpose or aggression, and require different skills by staff to recognise and attend to. Through mixed methods, we aim to test the feasibility, acceptability, and practicality of the manual. As part of this study, we will interview staff in care homes about the content, mode of intervention (manual), enablers and barriers to the intervention. We will interview family carers about the manual. We will use these for manual development modifying it in response to feedback. In addition, we will test the feasibility of primary and secondary outcomes for a definitive trial.","Care home inclusion criteria: Homes registered with CQC as a nursing home or care homes with nursing accessible from UCL (Maple House) within 60 minutes using public transport with a dementia-specific floor, unit, or community with a member of senior staff designated as a dementia lead or Champion.

5,Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue,Inflammatory polyarthropathies,ASSESSment of modified composite disease measures in recently diagnosed psoriatic arthritis,"Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory arthritis occurring in up to 30% of patients with skin psoriasis. Patients can develop swelling in joints, tendons, spine, skin, nails and eyes causing stiffness, pain and fatigue. Left untreated the inflammation results in damage causing further pain and restricted movement. Cohort studies have demonstrated progression of joint destruction, deteriorating functional status and a negative impact quality of life and ability to work. Historically the primary outcome measure in psoriatic arthritis trials have been measures that focus solely on the articular manifestations of disease. It is now recognised that this approach is insufficient to truly capture the totality of disease burden. In response there has been an international effort to devise a composite measure that captures all domains of disease. Several candidate measures have now been developed however these existing measures lacked patient involvement during their development (thereby potentially not fully capturing domains of disease important to patients) and remain time consuming to undertake. This study forms part of a National Institute for Health Research funded study to investigate the effect of enhanced surveillance for the early detection of arthritis amongst patients with psoriasis. A major theme of this programme is to improve outcome measurement in psoriatic arthritis through the incorporation of the patient perspective in existing composite measures and development of shortened versions for use in routine clinical practice. In order to modify the existing composite measures a staged qualitative study is already underway which will report a ranked list of outcomes important to patients mapped on to existing measures. In addition shorter versions of the measures will be developed from existing datasets. The purpose of this study is to compare the modified and shortened composite measures with the original versions and assess their validity (reliability, responsiveness and determining the minimally important difference).",Age 16 and over Fulfil ClASsification of Psoriatic ARthritis (CASPAR) diagnostic criteria for PsA Disease duration < 2 years (based on diagnosis not symptom onset)
9,Diseases of the circulatory system,Pulmonary heart disease and diseases of pulmonary circulation,STOPping Anticoagulation for isolated or incidental subsegmental Pulmonary Embolism,"Pulmonary embolisms (PE) occur when blood clots cause a blockage of the blood supply to the lungs. A small PE located in the subsegmental pulmonary vasculature is identified as a subsegmental PE (SSPE). Anticoagulants are used to treat SSPE and work by preventing new clots from forming whilst the bodyâs own mechanisms break down the clots, however they can also increase the risk of major and potentially life threatening bleeding. More recent observational data of routine care for SSPE showed very high complication rates of anticoagulation but in patients where treatment was withheld, this proved to be a safe strategy in terms of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE). Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) scans are now able to detect SSPE, however there are concerns that there is an over-diagnosis due to the incorrect interpretation of small artefacts. 1466 patients from approximately 50 sites will be recruited, these sites will consist of hospitals across the UK. Patients 18 and over with isolated SSPE, confirmed by either CTPA or CT thorax with IV contrast, will be eligible for the trial. Patients will be randomised to either receive standard anticoagulation for at least 3 months (control) or no anticoagulation for at least 3 months (intervention). The participant will receive telephone follow up calls at 4, 12 and 24 weeks following the end of their treatment, and additional data will also be taken from their medical records at these time points. The participant isnât required to be contacted for the 52 week follow up as the data will be extracted from the NHS Digital collection of Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). In total participation in the study will last 12 months.

PROs can include symptoms, function, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and perceptions of treatment.

11,Diseases of the digestive system,Diseases of liver,Detection and Assessment of Liver Fibrosis Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"Chronic liver disease is listed among the top 5 causes of premature death in the UK. The health issues associated with chronic liver disease are mostly due to scar tissue in the liver, known as liver fibrosis. When liver fibrosis is present, the tissue becomes stiffer, so that the liver feels more firm than normal. Fibrosis is graded according to the degree of stiffness, i.e. by assessing how much normal liver tissue has been replaced by scar tissue. While manual palpation is used to assess the stiffness of tissue in other parts of the body (e.g. breast), this is often impossible in liver due to itâs location underneath the rib cage. Until recently the only option to assess the liver for fibrosis was a liver biopsy, which is a procedure in which a small needle is inserted into the liver to collect a tissue sample. This sample is investigated under a microscope. Biopsy is so far the most reliable procedure, although it is invasive, painful and in rare cases leads to major bleeding. Our study aims to detect and assess the different stages of liver fibrosis, by âfeelingâ the stiffness of the liver, using a non-invasive technology, a new type of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) which will be combined with Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE). MRE is an emerging technique in clinical practice that uses low frequency sound waves to assess the tissueâs biomechanical properties, such as stiffness. The images can be captured using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). If proven useful, the new MRI scan will enable doctors to test whether a liver is scarred and if so how much scar tissue is present. This would allow doctors in the near future to choose the most appropriate therapy without having to perform an invasive liver biopsy.","Subjects will be recruited from one of the following 3 groups: - Adult healthy volunteers: 18 years of age or older, recruited via KCL advertisement. - Chronic liver disease patients aged 18 years or older scheduled for liver biopsy regardless of the presence of HCC. Patients will be selected by clinical partner (KCH); - Patients aged 18 years or older with advanced HCC who are due to commence systemic therapy with sorafenib (KCH). Principal inclusion criteria: - The capacity to understand the patient information sheet and the ability to provide written informed consent; - Routine clinical liver biopsy scheduled and/or within 6 months of study visit (preferably within 2 months) applicable for patients with chronic liver disease). - For patients in the HCC/sorafenib group, biopsy material is more rare (as HCC is diagnosed mainly using imaging studies) and we will allow specimens up to 2 years old to fullfil inclusion criteria."

Current first line treatments are inadequate and are associated with high rates of early relapse. Despite the recent introduction of novel agents for patients with relapsed disease prognosis is again very poor. There are currently no targeted treatments although monoclonal antibodies directed against Tfh surface markers including PD1 are available (Ansell et al, 2014) and have been trialled in other conditions. Similarly therapeutic anti-ICOS antibodies (MedImmune, MEDI-570) have been trialled in autoimmune conditions and a phase 1/2 trial for PTCL is about to start recruitment in Canada (Clinical Trials Identifier: NCT02520791). Over the next few years, therefore, treatment for PTCL is anticipated to change radically. A PTCL Biobank will be a valuable resource to expedite the development of diagnostic tests, based on the new genetics of these diseases and biobank samples will also be used to investigate biomarkers for response to specific therapies and the prediction of relapse.","Newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory PTCL patients including: Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma ALK+ anaplastic large-cell lymphoma ALK- anaplastic large-cell lymphoma PTCL-NOS Male or Females, aged 18 years or above.

The aim of this intervention is to enable people with cancer to experience a rapid reduction in stress and improved feelings of wellbeing and inner peace. In addition to being able to enter and immerse themselves in high quality peaceful, calm environments, people with cancer will be able to access a series of guided exercises to help them cultivate and experience self-compassion, which is known to be associated with several therapeutic effects. This is important because many people with cancer experience poor psychological wellbeing including increased levels of stress, anxiety, depression, guilt, anger, and other unwanted emotional states. Apart from being unpleasant, these states can contribute to poor engagement with therapy, poor lifestyle choices and a worsening of important relationships. The research plan involves working with people with cancer to design, create and test the intervention, with an initial co design workshop and 3 or 4 cycles of testing and improvement. Once a high enough quality version has been developed we will conduct research into the impact of the intervention and experience on the psychological wellbeing and stress levels of people with cancer. Once this project has been completed we will be a very good position to progress to a full randomised clinical trial of the intervention. The anticipated impact of the study findings for people affected by cancer include thousands of people affected by cancer having rapid access to high quality, calm, soothing virtual environments and quality controlled psychological exercises and activities likely to be associated with reduce stress levels, reduced levels of emotions such as anxiety, depression, shame and guilt, and improved levels of psychological wellbeing, inner peace, quality of life and life functioning.",- People affected by cancer - Aged over 18 years - Able to provide written consent

Patients with high risk SMM transform with a median of two years into active myeloma. A recent consensus of international myeloma experts defined a new group of patients with âearly myelomaâ. Those patients present with one of the newly established âSLiM CRABâ criteria, BMPC (bone marrow plasma cells) > = 60%, or FLC (free light chain) ratio > = 100, and or > 1 MRI detected focal lesion. Their risk for developing active, CRAB positive myeloma with 2 years varies between 64% and 95%. Denosumab a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and neutralises RANKL, has been shown to reduce the rates of skeletal-related events (SRE). It is currently approved for the prevention of SRE in adults with advanced malignancies involving bone and to treat patient with multiple myeloma. This is a randomised controlled phase II trial which aims to evaluate whether the reported benefits of denosumab, delay of SRE and decrease in myeloma growth promotion, reduce the risk of progression of high-risk SMM and of early âSLiM CRABâ myeloma into active CRAB positive myeloma. Approximately 50 patients with high risk SMM or SLiM CRAB are expected to be recruited from 7 sites within the UK over 2.5 years. Patients consenting to enter the trial will undergo a number of investigations during the screening process to assess their eligibility for the trial. Eligible patients will be randomised to receive treatment with either Denosumab or placebo every 4 weeks for 6 months, then every 3 months for a total of 3 years or until progression to active MM.

2,Neoplasms,Malignant neoplasm of breast,An observational study exploring treatment for women newly presenting with breast cancer-related upper limb lymphoedema.,"Lymphoedema affects approximately 20% women following breast cancer treatment. Without effective treatment symptoms worsen, e.g. increased arm size, denser arm, increased infection risk, lymphoedema more visible to others, difficulty with daily activities. Current treatment is based on âbest practiceâ, but we have no evidence for the most effective treatment to be given women when they first develop lymphoedema. Before undertaking an effectiveness study we need to know whether it is possible to conduct such a study. For example: how many participants should we recruit? can we recruit and retain enough participants? which interventions and assessment tools are acceptable to patients and practitioners? what primary (main) outcome should we use to detect a difference between intervention and comparator groups? This study aims to answers these questions. Participants will be women who developed lymphoedema symptoms within the previous 12 months but have not yet received treatment. They are recruited immediately following their first Lymphoedema Clinic appointment, and randomly allocated to one of two intervention groups or comparator group. All participants are given âusualâ UK lymphoedema care. Intervention group participants receive 10 extra treatment sessions over 2 week period followed by âusualâ care.

4,"Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases",Diabetes mellitus,THE IMPACT OF OBESITY AND TYPE 2 DIABETES ON INFLAMMATION AND HEALTH,"We are now beginning to understand that inflammation appears to significantly contribute to people developing diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and fatty liver disease. We understand the factors released from fat increase the inflammation, as such people with obesity have an increased risk of developing diabetes, fatty liver disease and cardiovascular disease. However we are unclear what may act as the factors that cause the fat to produce an inflammatory response which can act on other tissues and systems and how this may effect the health of the patient. Our work within the team has begun to show that bacterial fragments derived from the gut, referred to as endotoxin, can enter the circulation. These fragments are usually removed by the liver and good circulating fats but in people with diabetes and similar disorders this appears to fail, and the bacterial fragments appear to activate fat to produce an inflammatory response. We also understand that low levels of micronutrients such as Vitamin B12 can also impact on inflammatory processes. Currently we are still unclear on how bacterial fragments, and micronutrients that circulate in the blood act on different tissues including muscle and fat to cause differing inflammatory responses. Bariatric surgery has been shown to reduce inflammation at 1 year as measured by endotoxin and highly sensitive CRP, yet this surgery has a major impact on micronutrients and gut flora, therefore we wish to measure the levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors including current or novel biomarkers pre and post surgery and how adipose tissue changes, contributes to metabolic recovery.","Women , age >18 years and <65 Obese patients (Body Mass Index over 30 kg/m2) planned for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy as part of the clinical care Control subjects who are lean (BMI 18-25 kg/m2), overweight (BMI 25.1-30 kg/m2) and obese (BMI >30 kg/m2), who are undergoing elective (non-bariatric) surgery this will include (C-section surgery from pregnant women)."

Whilst cancer accounts for 28 percent of all-cause mortality within the UK, overall survival for people with cancer has doubled in the last 40 years. Surgery to remove the cancer remains the first option for treating cancer in most instances, but it can be associated with significant morbidity and deterioration in quality of life. This has resulted in the drive for additional options for both primary treatment and as adjunct therapy. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are currently the mainstays of adjunct therapy, but the utility and effectiveness vary between cancer types. They are associated with significant morbidity and adverse effects on quality of life, whilst the overall survival benefit is unclear in many types of cancer. As a result, there is an increased focus on the function and quality of life of those patients surviving their cancer treatments. High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a method of accurately delivering ablative ultrasound (US) generated high temperatures nonâinvasively to specific areas in the body using image (ultrasound or MR) guidance. It is currently used for prostate cancer; and there is also evidence it may be effective in treating recurrent prostate cancer. Short and medium-term data demonstrate that HIFU may be equivalent to some current prostate cancer therapies but with reduced morbidity. Despite the success and promise of HIFU as a treatment for prostate cancer, it is not widely used for other cancer types. To explore the possibility of new treatment targets we need to understand the impact of HIFU on surrounding tissues and organs. To accomplish this, we will perform a laboratory study on tissue samples to look at the effect of HIFU on the target tissue and surrounding structures.",1. Histologically confirmed malignancy 2.

2,Neoplasms,"Malignant neoplasms of ill-defined, secondary and unspecified sites",The Two Week Wait (2WW) study - an investigation of patient non-attendance at urgent referral appointments for suspected cancer.,"Since 2000, NHS patients with suspected cancer have been guaranteed to see a hospital specialist within two weeks of the GP requesting an urgent referral - a Two Week Wait (2WW) appointment. This policy intended to shorten time to diagnosis and treatment, and ultimately improve survival rates. In 2014, there were over 22,000 referrals in Leeds, approximately 10% resulted in a cancer diagnosis. However, a significant minority of patients are not seen within two weeks, largely due to patients not attending, cancelling or postponing the appointment. In 2012-2013, 16.5% of 2WW referred patients in the West Leeds Clinical Commissioning Group were not seen in two weeks. This study aims to investigate the reasons for non-attendance and identify interventions to improve timely access to urgent care. This study will be completed in five phases: Phase 1 - Categorisation of patients not seen within two weeks of referral drawing on Leeds NHS Hospital Trust data for approximately 6,000 patients in 2014 and 2015. Phase 2 - Analyse variation in factors between patients who postpone or cancel their appointment, and those who do attend, to identify predictors of non-attendance. This will use cross-sectional analyses within the same data set as Phase 1. Phase 3 - Compare rates of cancer diagnosis (and cancer stage at diagnosis) in attending patients with those who postpone, cancel or do not attend to assess the significance of non-attendance.

Sampling for GPs will aim for maximal sampling variation based on the following criteria: - practices with high and low rates of 2WW referrals, practices with high and low rates of DNAs for 2WW referrals (following adjustment for list size and patient age), urban, rural and remote practice locations, deprivation scores of practice catchment areasÍ¾ - individual GPs: gender and years of experience practicing in the UK. Phase 5 will include a sub-sample of patient and GP participants from Phase 4 who have expressed a willingness and interest in taking part in a workshop to discuss potential interventions to address the barriers to timely attendance and ideally, with the same sampling criteria for Phase 4 to achieve a similar range of variation."
13,Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue,Other joint disorders,The prevalence and impact of blood induced ankle arthritis in patients with moderate and severe haemophilia A and B: The HAPII study,"Haemophilia impairs bleeding control because of an absence of clotting factor VIII (haemophilia A) or factor IX (haemophilia B) resulting in bleeding into muscles and joints. Although treatment with artificial clotting factor has some effect on frequency of bleeds, most patients still experience ongoing spontaneous and traumatic bleeds in joints. Prolonged exposure of joint structures to blood leads to cartilage, structural and functional damage, ultimately resulting in pain and disability. Damage also leads to changes in joint function furthering the risk of subsequent mechanical joint and soft tissue haemorrhage. Ultimately, this vicious cycle results in cumulative and irreversible damage to joints with severe reduction in mobility. The introduction of clotting factor substitution, both prophylactically and on-demand, has dramatically improved life expectancy and quality of life in patients with haemophilia. The paradigm shift from treating a bleeding episode, to prevention with regular replacement therapy (prophylaxis) has seen a reduction in bleeding frequency. Since the introduction of clotting factor, the most common site for musculoskeletal bleeding has also changed from the knee to the tibiotalar (ankle) joint. Bleeding into the ankle joint is now estimated to account for 20% of all haemophilia-related bleeds in the UK. Despite this, little has been reported on the prevalence and impact of chronic ankle haemarthrosis.",Prevalence and impact study a) A consultant diagnosis of haemarthrosis induced ankle arthritis b) Haemophilia A and B c) Moderate or severe haemophilia diagnosed by level of clotting factor activity d) Aged 16 or over e) Participants who are able to give informed written consent f) Male g) The ability to read and understand English f) Consultant haematologist (online survey)
2,Neoplasms,Malignant neoplasms of male genital organs,"Randomised phase 3 trial of enzalutamide in androgen deprivation therapy with radiation therapy for high risk, clinically localised, prostate cancer","Participants are invited to take part in this research study that is testing a new treatment combination for localised prostate cancer that is going to be treated with radiotherapy. This is because they have prostate cancer that has features suggesting that its risk of recurrence after radiotherapy is higher than average. Current treatment for high risk localised prostate cancer involves radiation therapy with or without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Androgen deprivation therapy can have two components: 1. The main component is by stopping the release of androgen from the testicles. This is mainly done by using drugs that prevent the testicles from making androgens, and therefore reducing the levels of androgens in the body to low levels. These drugs are called luteinising releasing hormone analogues (LHRHA). This is usually part of the standard initial treatment of men in this situation. 2. The second component blocks the effects of androgens produced in other parts of the body with anti-androgen drugs. Anti-androgen drugs block testosterone and related androgens from attaching to molecules in the cancer cell called âandrogen receptors.â Blocking this attachment prevents androgens from having their effect. This might provide additional benefit in treating the cancer although this has not yet been proven. Several different types of anti-androgen drugs are available for use already. Enzalutamide is an anti-androgen drug approved for use in Europe for the treatment of adult men with metastatic prostate cancer that has continued to grow after hormone treatments and chemotherapy. The use of enzalutamide is currently experimental for localised prostate cancer. The treatment plan for these participants is androgen deprivation therapy combined with external beam radiotherapy to prevent further growth and spread of the prostate cancer. All participants will receive LHRHA treatment for 24 months and radiotherapy. Radiotherapy is standard practice and is not under investigation in this trial. Participants will be randomly allocated to either receive enzalutamide for 24 months or currently available anti-androgen therapy for 6 months. The study will compare the effectiveness of standard deprivation therapy and radiation therapy combined either with enzalutamide or with currently available anti-androgen drugs. The main aim of the study is to see which of these combinations of treatment is better for improving the survival of men in this situation. Recent studies show promising results from the use of enzalutamide in patients who had been treated with androgen deprivation therapy and were no longer responding to the standard anti-androgens. These men had prostate cancer that is at a more advanced stage than the stage of prostate cancer studied here. We want to see whether this positive effect can also be shown in men with high risk prostate cancer localised to the prostate area and planned for radiotherapy. This is the first study evaluating the potential benefit of enzalutamide in this patient group. To do this, a total of 800 participants will participate where half the participants on the study will receive enzalutamide with a LHRHA and radiation therapy and the other half (400 participants) will receive an already available anti-androgen with a LHRHA and radiation therapy. All participants on this study will receive active therapy and no placebo treatment will be used. The study is open label, meaning that both the participants and the investigators will know the treatment the participant will receive.","1.

5,Mental and behavioural disorders,Mood [affective] disorders,The Modular Protocol For Mental Health (MP:MH): A pilot randomised clinical trial of a transdiagnostic psychological treatment for mood and anxiety disorders in adults,"Anxiety and mood disorders are common conditions affecting up to 20% of adults. These conditions take different forms (or diagnoses) such as Agoraphobia, Panic Disorder, Depressive Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, and so on. Currently, our best non-drug (psychological) treatments only focus on individual diagnoses. So, there are separate treatments for Panic Disorder, or Depressive Disorder, or Social Anxiety, etc. These 'diagnosis-specific' treatments work well for people whose problems fit neatly into a single diagnosis. However, they work far less well for people with complex problems involving multiple diagnoses? e.g., someone who is depressed and socially anxious and suffering panic attacks. In fact, 50% of patients fail to repond well to these existing treatments. We have therefore developed a new psychological treatment for anxiety and mood problems (the Modular Protocol for Mental Health [MPMH]). Instead of focusing on any single diagnosis, MPMH combines the best treatment techniques into 10 modules (with clinician instructions and materials for service-users) each of which targets problems common across all of the different mood and anxiety diagnoses (e.g., intense emotions, negative thinking, upsetting memories, distressing habits). MP:MH should therefore be a better treatment for the large numbers of individuals whose problems do not fit neatly into a single diagnosis and for whom any treatments targeting a single diagnosis would leave significant difficulties unaddressed. We have tested MPMH on a series of people ('cases'), each with a complex mixture of anxiety and mood disorders, with promising results. In this study we are examining how well MP:MH works for these more complex cases, compared to the standard treatment people receive in NHS Secondary Care. The proposed trial is a patient level twoarm trial that compares MPMH to treatment as usual for patients aged >18 years (N=50) with co-morbid mood, anxiety or stress-disorder diagnoses recruited from secondary care (the Affective Disorders Pathway of the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust? CPFT).","Patients aged over 18 with a primary diagnosis of a unipolar mood, anxiety or stress disorder according to the DSM-5will be eligible for inclusion. The criteria for diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety disorder will be based on the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM (SCID-I/NP) which assesses disorders according to DSM diagnostic criteria. Participants will also need to score >10 on either the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) or Generalised Anxiety Disorder -7 item scale (GAD-7). Eligible participants will be prepared to: provide their name, phone number and address? provide the name and address of a local general practitioner? provide written informed consent? and be available to attend regular (i.e., weekly) sessions throughout treatment"
13,Mental and behavioural disorders,"Neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders",Children with OCD: Identifying Acceptable Support Strategies for Parents (CO-ASSIST),"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a severe and debilitating emotional disorder that frequently begins in childhood. The effect of obsessions and compulsions are not only distressing for a child experiencing them but also for the childâs parents/ carers. Without adequate support, the role of caring for children and young people can pose a significant burden to parents/carers. There is currently little evidence on how parents/carers and professionals view parental/carer support needs or the help they would find most useful. For this study funded by the NIHR Research for Patient Benefits programme, we will use qualitative mixed methods to identify workable ways of providing support that would meet the needs of parents/carers of children with OCD. Participants will be recruited from a range of NHS and third sector services and settings. The study has three phases, which will include a different set of participants for each phase (though some overlap is possible). Phase 1) We will invite 25-30 parents/carers to participate in a one-one interview. Separately we will hold 3-4 focus groups (of 6-8) with professionals who work with young people with OCD. Interviews and focus groups will be used to better understand parent/carer support needs. Phase 2) We will invite 18-25 key stakeholders (parents/carers, charities, clinicians, OCD researchers) to attend a one-day event where evidence from phase 1 will be discussed to identify strategies and resources to meet parents/carers needs. Phase 3) A panel of ten parents/carers and professionals will attend a meeting to discuss findings from phase 2 in order to inform the design of a potential intervention to support parents/carers of children with OCD. This study was initiated and designed through consultation with UK OCD charities and parents/carers and PPI involvement will continue throughout the research process. NB. All research activities will be undertaken remotely due to Covid-19.","Parent Sample: Parents/carers of children or young people aged 8-18 who have a diagnosis of OCD. The specified age range criteria for CYP is in accordance with NICE Clinical Guidelines for OCD (2005) which cover individuals from a minimum age of 8, the earliest point at which a diagnosis can usually be determined. We will also include parents of children who have recently (defined as within the last year) exceeded the age of 18 or who are not currently in their caregiver role, yet whose parenting/caring experience is still reflective of the needs of current parents/carers of CYP in this age range. A parentsâ/carersâ self-reported acknowledgement of their childâs formal diagnosis of OCD is adequate to meet to the objective of this study, avoiding the need for more formal potentially intrusive methods involving a formal proxy diagnostic measures or access to medical notes.Interpreters will be available for participants who are unable to speak English.

Version 1.,"Title Service Usersâ Perspectives on Accessing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Services within the East Riding of Yorkshire Background In the UK, 3.2 million people were diagnosed with diabetes in 2013 of which 90% of people are diagnosed with type 2. Diabetes related complications incur significant costs to the patient and NHS. To reduce the risk of complications NICE recommends yearly health checks and treatment targets. For people with type 2 diabetes in the East Riding of Yorkshire, 71.7% received all care processes, whilst only 37.8% achieved the treatment targets. Rational Capturing the perceptions of type 2 diabetes service users in the East Riding of Yorkshire will give further insight into the reasons for not meeting guidelines on reducing the risk of associated diabetes complications. Potential Benefits The findings will support relevant parties to further deliver effective, service user driven care within the East Riding of Yorkshire to suit type 2 diabetes service usersâ needs in conjunction with delivering national and local standards of care. This may help to reduce spending. Study Design This study will be undertaken using sequential mixed research methods, taking a two staged approach.

5,Mental and behavioural disorders,"Schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders",A Community-Based Intervention to Improve Health-Related Quality of Life in Children and adolescents of Parents with Serious Mental Illness: Feasibility Study,"Many children grow up with a parent who is experiencing a mental illness. These may be mild, short-term illnesses that are easily treatableÍ¾ however, some parental mental illness is severe and long-standing such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Studies have shown that children living or in regular contact with a parent with a severe mental illness, can be vulnerable to maltreatment, neglect and stigma and are at risk of developing mental health or behavioural problems, leading to a poor quality of life (QoL). Since 2011, the NSPCC has been providing and evaluating a programme called Family SMILES which aims to improve childrenâs self-esteem, enhance parentsâ protective abilities and improve parent-child relationships. This 3-year study builds on the NSPCCâs Family SMILES programme to produce an enhanced intervention, called Young SMILES, which aims to produce specific benefits for childrenâs health and functioning, and can be flexibly delivered within and outside NHS services. In Phase I (approved - 198409) we worked with children and parents/carers with severe mental illness, adults who had grown up with mentally ill parents, health, social care, education and voluntary sector professionals to develop Young SMILES. In Phase II 60 families will take part in a feasibility Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) over 12-months. Half will receive Young SMILES and half usual care. We will collect data at the start (baseline), 3 months (primary endpoint),at 6 and 12 months follow-up, on childrenâs health-related QoL, mental health literacy and problem-solving, depression and anxiety, family functioning and parent-child relationship, health and social care use. Practitioners from the NHS, Social Care and the Voluntary Sector will deliver the intervention. We will look at recruitment rates, randomisation procedures, intervention adherence and drop-out, describe the outcomes and costs and identify the most appropriate way to carry out a future larger-scale RCT.","1.

Therefore, we do not intend to carry out full clinical interviews with the parents and report diagnostic codes. We shall accept the primary and secondary diagnoses reported by a key health professional, such as the GP, care coordinator and key worker, as most of these parents are likely to receive secondary care or be monitored in primary care.

This would cover a range of areas, such as how the patientsâ mental health is, the level of risk they pose to themselves or other people, how good their quality of life is and how well they are progressing towards rehabilitation back in to society. Professionals working in forensic psychiatric services in the UK will be asked to fill in a survey about what they think are the most important things to measure. There will also be several faceâto-face events, including focus groups of professionals, to further explore the themes that come up. Patients will also be interviewed in depth to gain their views about what is important. A panel of both patients and professionals will be presented with information from the earlier stages and asked to rate the areas that they think are most important to measure. This will happen repeatedly, until there is agreement about the most important areas. The research team will then design questions that address these areas and ask the panel to decide which questions are the best. This will produce a new tool consisting of one set of questions for patients and another for professionals.

4,"Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases",Malnutrition,Managing malnutrition in later life: exploring the views and dietary practices of older people at risk of malnutrition and their carers,"Malnutrition is a serious condition that occurs when a personâs diet lacks the amount of nutrients they need. It is a common problem in older people that can lead to weight loss, weakness and tiredness. If left unchecked, it can cause older people to become underweight, and more prone to severe illness and hospitalisation. Malnutrition can go unnoticed in the early stages as it can be difficult to recognise, and General Practitioners or practice nurses may not have the time or have received training on how to deal with this condition. Currently, little is known about the dietary choices made by older people at risk of malnutrition, how it is recognised and acted upon, and how it can be improved. Alongside this, older people may be prone to dehydration as a result of not drinking enough, loss of fluid or a combination of both. When you get older your sense of thirst can be reduced and you may not realise that you are not drinking enough. Dehydration can make you feel unwell and can lead to hospital admission if not addressed. We currently donât know enough about older peopleâs views around hydration, what they do to make sure they drink enough and what support they might need. In this study, we will interview older people who are underweight or at risk of malnutrition and friend/family carers of older people who need help to prepare their meals. We will explore the decisions they make about the food they buy and eat, their knowledge about dietary needs in later life, the advice and support they might need and the best place to seek support. We will also ask older people and their carers for their views on how primary care could support nutritional and healthy eating and drinking advice e.g. from the GP, practice nurse or health care assistant. This study will lead to further work in which we would explore ways primary care can help older people make changes to their diet in order to maintain a healthy weight and drink enough and receive all the nutrients they need.","Community dwelling people (including those living in supported housing), aged > = 75 years old, identified to be malnourished or at risk of malnutrition (BMI< 20 or estimated to be low by clinician).

Marketing surrounding this product group and the social consequences of acne may result in patient demands or perceived preferences, which may influence the recommendations of health professionals. Although clinical guidelines for acne exist,the role of pharmacists in helping patients to self-care is generally not covered. In the present study we will undertake semi-structured interviews with dermatologists to obtain insight into their perspectives on the management of acne in pharmacies. The data generated from these interviews will aid the development of questions for a Delphi process in an attempt to gain consensus from an expert panel on the severity of acne which should be managed in pharmacies, the criteria that should prompt pharmacists to refer patients with acne to their GP and the most suitable over the counter treatment options for acne. This information will be used to aid the development of a guideline that can be used to help pharmacists who request treatment for acne in pharmacies. We will also conduct semi-structured interviews with the pharmacists who have used the guideline in practice to explore their views on the usefulness of the guideline in practice.","For the dermatologists: 1.

Hearing loss increases dementia risk more than lacking education, being diabetic or depressed or having a poor diet. Therefore, untreated hearing loss may be a missed opportunity to delay and prevent dementia in a substantial number of people, but we need research to find out if treating hearing loss is effective. We want to find out if a hearing aid intervention can prevent or delay the onset of dementia in older adults who are at greater risk of developing dementia (i.e. those with mild cognitive impairment). Before we can do a full trial to answer this question, we need to run a pilot trial to see if we can recruit participants and assess the acceptability of the proposed interventions. We plan to compare two interventions in this pilot trial. The hearing intervention will involve hearing aid provision and support over four sessions, while the healthy ageing intervention will involve standard audiological care (i.e. the participant will be informed of their hearing loss and advised to see their GP) and four one-to-one sessions with a researcher on behavioural changes that can promote healthy ageing and may reduce risk of progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. We will recruit people aged 55 years and over, who have a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and evidence of hearing loss. Participants will be recruited from local London memory services and the trial visits will be conducted in the participantsâ homes.

6,Diseases of the nervous system,Other degenerative diseases of the nervous system,Oxford Genetic Frontotemporal Dementia Initiative (Oxford GENFI),"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a common cause of young onset dementia. Its effect on people of working age with young families represents a major health and economic burden on society. The only known risk factors for FTD at present are genetic with abnormalities (mutations) in three genes accounting for the majority of familial FTD. There are now promising avenues for treatment of these disorders but we still do not know when drugs should be started or how we should measure the response to treatment. This study investigates people with or who are at genetic risk of FTD, including people who have developed symptoms and those who have a high risk of developing symptoms in the future because they are family members of someone who carries an FTD gene. Study participants will have psychology testing, brain imaging, blood tests and spinal fluid collection (by lumbar puncture) in order to investigate the patterns of change in these different tests over time. The results will help us to understand the disease from its very earliest stages. It is expected that 80 participants will be seen in Oxford, being assessed three times in total. The key outcomes of the study are to (1) improve understanding of how brain systems break down in genetic FTD and how this break down relates to the underlying behavioural and cognitive deficits, (2) develop markers which help identify the disease at its earliest stage, and (3) develop markers that allow the progression of the disease to be tracked. The eventual aim will be to use these markers in future clinical trials of drugs in genetic FTD. The results of this project will also lead to improvement in the recognition and diagnosis of genetic FTD as well as provide improved information about prognosis for patients and members of their family.","1.

2,Neoplasms,Malignant neoplasms of thyroid and other endocrine glands,A phase I/II study evaluating the safety and activity of Pegylated recombinant human Arginase (BCT-100) in Relapsed/refractory cancers of Children and young adults,"PARC is an international phase I/II trial evaluating the safety and activity of pegylated recombinant human arginase (BCT-100) in children and young people with relapsed/refractory leukaemia, neuroblastoma, sarcoma and high grade gliomas (brain cancers). Currently the outcomes for these patients are poor and the therapeutic options are limited with a significant toxicity burden. Therefore new treatments which work in different ways to standard chemotherapy are urgently needed. Research has shown that arginine (a nutrient) is important in the survival of cancer cells. BCT-100 is a drug which can deplete arginine levels and starve cancer cells â a completely new approach. BCT-100 has been tested in adults and shown to be active with almost no side-effects. This trial will test whether this dose of BCT-100 is also safe and active in children and young adults with relapsed/refractory leukaemia, neuroblastoma, sarcoma and high grade glioma. The trial will also study how BCT-100 is broken down in the body and look for new biological markers of treatment response. Up to 64 children and young adults with relapsed cancers will be recruited over 2 years.","â¢ Aged 1- < 25 years old â¢ Histologically confirmed disease in one of the following four cohorts.

9,Diseases of the circulatory system,Ischaemic heart diseases,Dose Effect Relationship of a Single Dose of Rituximab on the Kinetics of B Lymphocytes in Patients with Acute STSegment Myocardial Infarction,"Heart attacks are caused by blockages of arteries in the heart. This is treated by unblocking the artery with a balloon and stent during a procedure called primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). Despite this therapeutic advance, up to 50% of the final heart attack size is caused by this treatment, by a process termed reperfusion injury. Reperfusion injury contributes to the persistent morbidity and mortality suffered by 15% of heart attack patients at 6 months, despite successful PPCI. The immune system plays a pivotal role in orchestrating reperfusion injury. We have demonstrated in animal models that selective depletion of B cells reduces the size of the heart attack size and preserves heart function. The objective of RITA-MI is to assess if a CD20 monocolonal antibody - rituximab, used to successfully treat rheumatoid arthritis, can be repurposed to safely suppress the B cell immune response at the time of an acute heart attack, thereby allowing further study into its ability to reduce heart attack size, promote healing and thereby improving clinical outcome.",1.

1,Certain infectious and parasitic diseases,Tuberculosis,The role of viral coinfection in the progression of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in children,"Every year, about one million children are diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) and about 250,000 of them die. TB is caused by infection with the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Following exposure to Mtb, children are at much greater risk of developing TB disease than adults and they are more prone to severe disease. Differences in how their immune systems function are thought to underlie this, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood. Children are exposed to multiple infectious agents which may change the functioning of their immune systems and how they control other infections. Evidence suggests that immunological changes induced by viral coinfections may increase susceptibility to TB disease, but there are few studies. Studies exploring interactions between Mtb, viral coinfections and the immune system will help our understanding of the immune responses important for controlling TB infection. This knowledge could contribute towards the development of improved vaccines, immunotherapies and diagnostics. Understanding whether viral coinfections change the risk of developing TB disease is also important for clinical management and public health policies. This study will compare blood sampled from children during an acute viral infection and when well, and from adult and paediatric healthy controls. In the laboratory we will infect the blood samples with mycobacteria and look to see whether there are differences in how the mycobacteria grow. In order to understand the mechanisms behind any observed differences, we will also measure and compare immune responses in the blood. We will look to see if age affects mycobacterial growth and immune responses. We will also compare blood sampled from children before and after immunisation, so as to study the influence of vaccines on mycobacterial immune responses. This in turn should increase our understanding of the effects of infections, such as measles, on mycobacterial containment.","PAEDIATRIC SUBJECTS 1. Child is aged 0- < 18 years AND 2.

6,Diseases of the nervous system,Diseases of myoneural junction and muscle,Immune Factors in Neurological Diseases,"Neurological disorders are often difficult to treat. We, and other clinical researchers, have shown an autoimmune, usually antibody mediated, cause for some such conditions in several studies. Affected patients are of both sexes, all ages and all races. Examples include, myasthenia gravis and, most recently, novel forms of encephalitis and epilepsy. The presence of an immune component to a neurological disease offers clinicians the opportunity to treat patients with drugs which suppress the immune system, such as steroids. This is an exploratory study to examine longitudinal observational clinical data from patients with a possible autoimmune component to their neurological condition. The study aims to correlate these clinical findings with laboratory immunological findings from bodily fluids (blood, spinal fluid, urine and saliva) using both established and novel assays and determine the clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients who respond to immune-therapies. This clinical and immunological characterisation will allow description of associated phenotypes, biomarkers and responses to treatments. This will be true for both well-established and novel antibodies or immunological parameters. Further cellular and other immunogenetic laboratory work will seek to understand the biology of neurological conditions, predisposing factors and to identify possible targets for future drug development.","Patients: â¢ There is or may be an autoimmune component to their neurological disease. â¢ Individual and/or parent/guardian willing to give informed consent for participation in the study OR: â¢ where an individual is deemed to lack capacity to consent, a declaration from a designated consultee.

14,Diseases of the genitourinary system,Renal failure,Progression of Arterial and Cardiac disease in Kidney patients and controls - An extended study (PACK-Extended),"Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects 10-15% of the general population. CKD patients suffer from higher risks of heart attacks and strokes. The exact nature of why there is an increased risk is unknown. We have, through a previous study, demonstrated in patients in different stages of CKD and kidney transplant patients have highly abnormal blood vessel reactivity, thickened blood vessel walls, and atherosclerosis (furring) within the blood vessel. Although we know inflammation causes the abnormal blood vessel reactivity, which in turn causes the atherosclerosis. No study has examined the natural and long-term progression of blood vessel reactivity, blood vessel wall thickness, and furring of blood vessels in CKD and transplant patients. This study hopes to look at the natural progression of these blood vessel parameters, the reactivity, wall thickness, and furring of the blood vessels. We will be looking at these parameters by measuring Brachial Artery Flow Mediated Dilation (Ultrasound scan on the arm), carotid and brachial intima-media thickness (Ultrasound scan on arm and neck), carotid-femoral wave velocity (a pressure probe placed on neck and groin), ankle-brachial index (blood pressure measurements on arm and leg), 12-lead electrocardiogram (heart tracing) and blood tests. As we will recruit patients who have previously participated within the Progression of Atherosclerosis in Chronic Kidney Disease (PACK) study, we will evaluate the changes in these parameters that occurred over the 1-2 years between PACK and this study. No new patients will be recruited into this study. All the examinations on research participants will be completed within a day in the Vascular Laboratory at the Cardiovascular Sciences Research Centre of St Georgeâs University of London. This new information on the natural progression of blood vessel parameters may help guide treatment in reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes of CKD patients in the future.",- Age 18-80 - Stable kidney functions for 3 months or stable on dialysis for 3 months The proposed study will involve patient groups as follows: 1.

2,Neoplasms,"Malignant neoplasms of ill-defined, secondary and unspecified sites",An investigation describing the Long and Short-Term effects of Standard-of-Care treatments for people with Cancer,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPI) are drugs that release cancer immunity. ICPI cause immune attack on normal organs resulting in immune related adverse events (IrAE) including bowel inflammation called immune related colitis (IR-colitis). We will describe the clinical and pathological features of IR-colitis, exploring a role for viruses including Epstein Barr virus (EBV) which lives harmlessly in most people. More broadly, the study will explore clinical, pathological and microbiological features associated with ICPI treatment, cancer control and IrAE. At the University Hospitals Birmingham, we will recruit fifty consenting people treated with ICPI at standard of care clinic appointments. We will take scheduled blood and body product samples before during and after treatment induction. Also, we will recruit groups of around ten consenting patients for particular experiments, requesting unscheduled samples. This may include additional tissue sampling during standard procedures or additional non-invasive biopsies. These may include people presenting with IR-colitis, treated with ICPI, with other IrAE, with cancer without ICPI treatment, with colitis for other reasons, and healthy volunteers. Samples from these groups may be used to characterise the values or variation of particular measurements to better understand their meaning in the main cohort. Retrospective clinical data and archival pathology samples surplus to clinical need will be explored in relation to specific questions relating to ICPI treatment, IrAE and cancer control within scope of the project. In particular, we will focus on data and samples relating to previous episodes of IR-colitis, inflammatory bowel disease and EBV-lymphoproliferation and will seek evidence of reactivation of EBV and other viruses.

19,Diseases of the nervous system,Episodic and paroxysmal disorders,Transforming the mental health treatment of children and young people with epilepsy,"Background At least half of young people with epilepsy also have mental health problems like depression, anxiety and behaviour problems. The mental health problems impact so much on all areas of life including family, friendships and education that the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends that the psychological needs of young people with epilepsy should always be considered. However, existing epilepsy services are separate from mental health services so mental health problems arenât treated as well as they could be. The proposed treatment There is an exciting new psychological treatment for childhood anxiety, depression and behavioural problems. This Modular Approach to Therapy for Children (âMATCHâ) can be given within epilepsy services, by staff without special mental health training and over the telephone/Skype which many families prefer and which reduces costs to the NHS so more children can be treated nationwide. The treatment is flexible so can be given to parents and/or the young person according to age and type of problem. This application is the first stage of the programme of research only. In the first stage of the programme of research we will: 1. Develop a new module so the treatment meets the special mental health needs of young people with epilepsy. In future stages, we will: 2. Develop a training package for NHS staff to deliver this treatment within epilepsy services. 3. Assess nearly 1200 young people with epilepsy. Those people with significant mental health problems will be invited to either a) receive the new treatment plus their usual care for mental health problems or b) continue to receive their usual care. We will compare the two groups after treatment (six months) to see which group does better. 4. Talk to young people and families to understand what treatment was like and how to improve it.","Attending clinics for the treatment of epilepsy; aged 3-18 years, meeting diagnostic criteria for a common mental health disorder such as depression, anxiety or disruptive behaviour disorder."
11,Diseases of the digestive system,Diseases of liver,"Efficacy of the combination of simvastatin plus rifaximin in patients with decompensated cirrhosis to prevent ACLF development: a multicenter, double-blind, placebo controlled randomized clinical trial.","Cirrhosis is the final stage of liver diseases, and currently, there is no effective treatment, with liver transplantation being the only curative solution in selected patients. As the number of donor organs for liver transplantation is limited and criteria for transplantation are strict, the current management of cirrhosis consists of treating its complications. However, there is no effective therapy that prevents or cures the disease itself. Rifaximin is an antibiotic that acts in the gastrointestinal tract. It is poorly absorbed to the general circulation and has low toxicity and good tolerability. It is currently approved for use in patients with cirrhosis to prevent recurrent hepatic encephalopathy. Rifaximin decreases the transit of bacteria and bacterial products from the gut to the general circulation, preventing the chronic inflammation that takes place in cirrhotic patients. Recent investigations have shown that simvastatin, a drug which is widely used to treat high cholesterol levels for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, may have beneficial effects in patients with cirrhosis by preventing the progression of the disease and its complications. Although in the past decades there was a concern about its use in patients with liver disease due to its rare adverse effects (liver and muscle toxicity), recent clinical trials have shown that it can be safely used in patients with cirrhosis. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of oral administration of simvastatin plus rifaximin in halting the progression of decompensated cirrhosis as assessed by the time to first incidence of ACLF during treatment period.","Patients included into the study must meet all the following criteria: 1. Age > = 18 years old. 2. Cirrhosis defined by standard clinical criteria, ultrasonographic findings and/or histology. Cirrhosis of any aetiology may be included.

Highly effective contraceptive methods will include: intrauterine device, bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomized partner and sexual abstinence. Hormonal contraceptive methods will be avoided due to the risk of adverse events and impairment of liver function."
18,"Symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified",General symptoms and signs,Exploring the Bases of Fatigue in Children with Unilateral Hearing Loss,"Children with hearing loss have reported increased levels of fatigue in their daily lives. Interestingly, preliminary research has shown children with unilateral hearing loss (UHL; hearing loss in one ear only) also show similar levels of fatigue. This can affect many aspects of a childâs life. Children with UHL experience problems both academically and psychosocially, with research showing that students with UHL perform worse in speech language comprehension and have poorer academic performance compared to children who have normal hearing (NH). This potential rise in fatigue in children with UHL may account for the above problems. This study aims to characterise the fatigue experienced by these children by conducting interviews with children with UHL and their parents/guardians. Separate interviews with children and their parents/guardians will explore the nature of fatigue, its impact, and if/how it changes during different daily activities. Currently, self-report questionnaires are the most widely used tool to measure fatigue, but these are dependent on a personâs state of mind. We are going to administer current-measures of fatigue and ask for feedback regarding their relevancy, as well as conducting an online study to compare results between questionnaires. We will also interview clinicians who manage children with UHL to explore the effect of fatigue on the clinical management of these children. We will also monitor factors that could contribute to fatigue during fatiguing listening tasks (two hours max) or following normal day-to-date activities, such as school (up to two weeks in children with UHL, children with bilateral hearing loss (BHL; hearing loss in both ears) and children with NH. These factors could include head movements, heart rate or changes in acoustic environment. This will allow us to determine the underlying causes of fatigue and provide insight on possible future treatments to reduce fatigue in children with UHL.","Children with UHL: - Aged 6-16. - Has received a diagnosis of permanent unilateral hearing loss: * If children are identified via non-NHS routes, a self-report of a diagnosis of UHL from parents will be accepted. * If children are identified via an NHS service, a diagnosed with UHL must be confirmed using one of the following. definitions: = Calculated or predicted average pure tone air conduction threshold at 0.5, 1, 2 kHz of any level greater than or equal to 20 dB HL or pure tone air conduction thresholds greater than 25 dB HL at two or more frequencies above 2 kHz in the affected ear with an average pure tone air conduction threshold in the good ear less than or equal to 15 dB (following CDC (2005) guidelines). = A pass result on newborn hearing screening in one ear only. - Have normal or corrected-to-normal vision confirmed via parental self-report. - Must use English in home environment or at school. - Able and willing to give informed consent (16 years or older), or to give assent together with consent from a parent/guardian. - For qualitative study: Able to attend an in person interview together with a parent/guardian or attend remotely via a video call if necessary. - For experimental and observational study: Able to attend an in-person testing session together with a parent/guardian. - For online element: have access to a computer with internet.

2,Diseases of the respiratory system,Other acute lower respiratory infections,NOVEMBR: Non-Invasive Ventilation for the Management of Children with Bronchiolitis: a feasibility study. Phase 2: Delphi process and consensus meeting.,"Bronchiolitis is a common, viral, chest infection that affects babies and young children up to 2 years of age. Bronchiolitis usually occurs during the winter months (October â March). A small number of children (around 3 out of every 100) need to come into hospital for help with their breathing or feeding. Children who come into hospital for help with their breathing often receive oxygen therapy. There are different ways to give oxygen therapy, including through a face mask, head box or nasal cannula. All of these interventions are used in current clinical practice. Up until now, studies have used different ways of measuring the effects of treatment. This makes comparing the results of trials very difficult. The aim of the NOVEMBR study is to develop a âcore outcome setâ. This is a list of outcomes that all trials in bronchiolitis should measure and report. Having a core outcome set will help to make sure that the results from all trials can be combined to get a better understanding of which treatments are best. An outcome set has been derived from a systematic review and parent interviews conducted in the first phase of the study. This outcome set will be used to produce a Delphi survey for the second phase of the study. The aim of the Delphi phase of this study is to agree which outcomes should be included in the core outcome set. As it is important that the outcomes included in a core set are relevant to everyone looking after children with bronchiolitis, health care professionals and parents/legal representatives will be asked to take part in a Delphi survey and to attend a face-to-face consensus meeting involving all stakeholder groups.","1) Parents or legal representatives of a child hospitalised between 2016-2018 with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis (including emergency department (ED) attenders), aged 0-24 months, with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis defined as per NICE Bronchiolitis Guidelines (2015) [25]: Diagnose bronchiolitis if the child has a coryzal prodrome lasting 1 to 3 days, followed by: persistent cough and either tachypnoea or chest recession (or both) and either wheeze or crackles on chest auscultation (or both). 2) HCPs (e.g. nurses, doctors, physiotherapists) who have at least six months experience in managing children diagnosed with bronchiolitis."
5,Mental and behavioural disorders,"Schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders",Understanding strange feelings and experiences: A qualitative study,"Sometimes, people have strange feelings and experiences â like feeling that they are âspaced outâ, emotionally numb, unreal, disconnected, or âtrapped in a bubbleâ. These experiences are sometimes called âdissociationâ or âdepersonalisationâ, and can include experiences like having unwanted memories repeat in a very realistic way, or even having memory blanks. These experiences can cause a range of responses, including cognitive (misinterpretations, thoughts, beliefs), emotional (fear, anxiety), and physical (âfight / flightâ) reactions. We believe that these responses are distressing in themselves, but also that they may cause other important presentations if they are misinterpreted by the person who is dissociating. One such example is in delusions and hallucinations in psychosis. In persecutory (paranoid) delusions, it has been demonstrated that anomalous experiences â such as dissociative experiences - initiate a âsearch for meaningâ, ultimately leading to adoption of a (âdelusionalâ) threat belief (Freeman et al, 2002). Despite this, and despite estimates that up to fifty percent of people with non-affective psychosis report concurrent dissociative experiences (Renard et al., 2016), these experiences have often been overlooked. To date, the role of dissociation in non-affective psychosis has not yet been tackled in a systematic programme of research. We are therefore undertaking a three-year programme of research supported by the Wellcome Trust with the aim of better understanding dissociation in non-affective psychosis. Conducting this qualitative (interview) study is a crucial first step in the progress of this work. The primary outcome of the study is to gain a patient perspective of this poorly-understood set of experiences - particularly what they think started, maintained and ended their dissociative experiences. A secondary outcome will be a clearer picture of service usersâ opinions and beliefs about dissociation, both at the time of the experience, and after it had ended. In many psychological explanations, these beliefs and opinions are a key factor in the development and continuation of the problem. As yet, there has been no investigation into the thoughts and beliefs people have about their dissociative experiences in psychosis.","- Willing and able to give informed consent to participate in the study - Any gender, aged 16 years or above - Currently high levels of dissociation, as indicated by self-report and a score of 36 or above on the DES-II (Carlson & Putnam, 1993). - Primary diagnosis of a psychosis spectrum disorder. - Willing to allow their Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust care team to be notified of their participation in the study"
19,"Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes",Other and unspecified effects of external causes,Eosinophilic and Immune Mechanistic Study - Advanced clinical blood analysis: imaging flow cytometry for detection and differentiation of eosinophilia in multiple diseases of childhood,"Over the last few decades there has been an increase in the number of children with eosinophilic diseases. such as IgE and Non IgE mediated food allergy, Eosinophilic Oesophagitis, Hyper IgE Syndrome, Allergic BronchoPulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA) in children with cystic Fibrosis, and Multi-system Allergic Inflammation in Childhood (MoSAIC). Many of these children go on to develop atopic diseases such as asthma, eczema, hay fever and food allergy. We still do not know why more individuals are developing these diseases. We know that children born in families with some of the disorders are genetically inherited whilst others are due to factors in the environment. Some children with eosinophilic disease may beat a higher risk of developing food allergies, rhinitis and asthma later in life. A number of inflammatory disorders that particularly afflict children (above) are characterised by increased numbers of circulating and tissue eosinophils. Eosinophils contribute to disease symptoms so better tests for looking at these cells are critical to disease diagnosis and monitoring. Our aim is to develop a simple blood test to improve existing hospital-based blood tests and replace difficult tests such as endoscopic biopsies from the gastrointestinal tract and the lungs. A technique called imaging flow cytometry enables fast capture of images of thousands of blood eosinophils; these images then allow us to better understand the way the cells work. To progress this to clinical utility we propose to use imaging flow cytometry to analyse blood samples from children. This project offers a unique opportunity to develop a new test for diagnosis and monitoring of eosinophilic disorders among children. It is hoped that this study will provide the foundation for a later study that will look at how we can diagnose and prevent eosinophilic diseases developing in infancy and childhood. Your child will have an opportunity to join this further study once the pilot study is completed.","A subject can be included in this study if the following criteria are met: 1.

However, medication is not a useable solution for a significant range of patients and there is high demand for effective psychological interventions as alternatives to medication. Mindfulness based interventions (MBI) may contribute to fill this gap. MBI enhance the ability to self-regulate attentional states and facilitate the awareness of the present moment with a non-judgmentally attitude. There is promising evidence to support a direct effect of MBI on reducing core ADHD symptoms, improving working memory capacity, attention, executive control and emotion regulation. Overall, studies suggest effects of MBI that are of same order of magnitude as the effects of medication for ADHD. However, the design of more controlled clinical trials is needed to empirically explore the efficacy of MBI on ADHD symptoms. Furthermore, it still remain unclear what psychological and/or behavioural mechanisms may be mediating treatment response in ADHD. One robust candidate is excessive mind-wandering (MW). Excessive, spontaneous MW (i.e. thoughts constantly on the go, thoughts flitting from one topic to another and multiple thoughts at the same time) is a highly characteristic and measurable component of ADHD, a strong predictor of ADHD symptoms and ADHD-associated impairments in daily life. MBI have been proposed to have positive regulatory effects on these MW associated processes. We will conduct a pilot clinical trial powered to contribute to establish the effects of MBI on reducing ADHD symptoms as compared to a psychoeducation program. We will also investigate measures of MW and MW-associated neural processes (EEG) which are proposed as the underlying mechanism that drives the treatment response.",-Currently meeting diagnostic criteria for DSM-5 ADHD -18-65 years -Able to provide inform consent -No currently taking psychoactive medication or on a stable regime of psychoactive medication that is not planned to change over the next 12 months -Informed decision to take part in the study including a commitment to completion of the 8 week course and home practice - English sufficient to answer questionnaires and interviews conducted in English.
5,Mental and behavioural disorders,"Organic, including symptomatic, mental disorders",START,"The GREAT study will investigate the impact of playing a Grammatical Reasoning brain training task on overall brain function (cognition) and day-to-day function in people over 50. The study builds on existing work that has shown very promising results with brain training approaches in older adults. There is good evidence that playing brain training games leads to improvements in brain functions including memory and reasoning. There is also a suggestion that regular involvement in brain training games might help reduce the risk of cognitive decline and dementia later in life. It appears that reasoning, or problem-solving, is particularly important as it is one of the first abilities to decline with age. This study will use this evidence to target reasoning in a specific brain training task. It will also explore the potential role of genetic factors in how people perform in the task. The study will compare the impact of a Grammatical Reasoning Task (GREAT) with a control task consisting of simple picture-matching. Over 7000 participants will be randomly allocated to either GREAT or the control and will be asked to play the task as often as they wish for a period of six weeks. Both tasks will be delivered entirely online so people will access the study from home on their computers. This will be achieved through our dedicated online research platform, PROTECT, which hosts a cohort of over 20,000 older adults who have provided DNA samples as part of a longitudinal study. This study will measure the impact of the training on cognition and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living. Assessments will be completed online at baseline, two/six weeks and six months. Overall, this study aims to generate exciting new data about how brain training could be included in guidance on healthy ageing.",1. Adults over 50 2.

The nature of thermal ablation means that it leads to the release of tumour antigen which may have an effect on subsequent tumour behaviour, although this effect has not as yet been characterised. The aim of this study is to explore the immune response to ablation of colorectal liver metastases focusing particularly on the release of damage associated molecular patterns capable of stimulating the release of neutrophil extracellular traps, a key component of the innate immune response. In addition we will explore the role of immunosuppressive enzyme IDO in determining the response to ablation. We will seek to determine the impact of these processes on progression free survival following ablation of colorectal liver metastases.","1) Patients undergoing percutaneous, laparoscopically assisted or open ablation (either microwave or irreversible electroporation) of colorectal liver metastases 2) The ability to provide informed consent for participation in research 3) Patients taking immunosuppressive medication (e.g. steroids, cyclosporin, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate)"
10,Diseases of the respiratory system,Chronic lower respiratory diseases,Studying endothelial senescence and dysfunction in chronic lung disease,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common chronic lung disease, mainly caused by cigarette-smoking. COPD patients and patients with other lung disorders, often suffer from cardiovascular (heart) disease. Indeed, cardiovascular disease appears to be the main cause of death in COPD patients, but the link between the diseases is not fully understood. The cells that line the blood vessels, known as endothelial cells, have a critical role in maintaining a healthy heart and blood vessels. Ageing of these cells leads to failure of their function and to cardiovascular disease. We have been able to isolate cells from blood that turn into endothelial cells and repair damaged vessels. We found that unlike healthy cells, those from smokers and COPD patients are dysfunctional, prematurely aged, and cannot repair blood vessel damage. We aim to understand the mechanisms causing premature ageing of vessels and heart disease in COPD patients and other chronic lung disorders, which is also relevant to other patients with cardiovascular disease. We aim to discover new treatments that prevent premature ageing of blood vessels and reduce heart disease.","All subjects must be able to give informed consent.

13,Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue,Systemic connective tissue disorders,SALivary electro-stimulation for the treatment of dry mouth in patients with Sjogren's syndrome: a multicentRe randomISEd sham-controlled double-blind study,"Dry mouth is a common manifestation of primary Sjogrenâs syndrome (pSS) affecting speech, swallowing, oral health and quality of life. It is a distressing and persistent condition which can lead to long-lasting oral discomfort, dental infections, diminished quality of life, social isolation and loneliness. Unfortunately, current therapies of dry mouth are often unsatisfactory, only offering transient relief, may be expensive and may result in adverse effects. A novel intraoral electronic device has recently been developed to treat dry mouth. The device, acting as a âsalivary pacemakerâ, is taken home by the patient and works by being placed in the mouth as and when needed. It harmlessly releases electrical pulses to stimulate the nerves (electrostimulating) associated with salivary gland secretion. However, the electrical pulse intensity is below the human sensitivity level, therefore it cannot be felt by the patient. The aim of SALRISE is to determine whether the device reduces dry mouth symptoms in patients with pSS. 130 participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group will receive an active, electrostimulating device that provides mechanical/tactile stimulation but also releases electrical pulses. The second group will receive a sham device that does not release electricity but provides mechanical/tactile stimulation only. They will be asked to use the device for 12 months. Neither doctors nor participants will be aware of which devices are functional or sham to ensure that the study results cannot be influenced. Participants will attend 5-6 hospital appointments over 12 months, where they will be asked to complete questionnaires regarding their dry mouth symptoms, oral health, quality of life and use of health services.

5,Mental and behavioural disorders,Unspecified mental disorder,Assessing mistrust in young people: A study in child and adolescent services,"In everyday life, we all make decisions about whether to trust other people. Sometimes, it can be difficult to trust people and we might feel suspicious about others. Trust has been described as a decision to depend on others in the face of vulnerability and uncertainty, involving a judgment about anotherâs intentions towards you. Our ability to trust others is thought to exist on a continuum, with some people feeling overly mistrustful and suspicious of others. Excessive mistrust is technically called âparanoiaâ in psychiatry, defined as the unfounded fear that others are intentionally trying to harm you. Research shows that feeling very mistrustful may be a common problem during adolescence. However, very little is known about how these issues affect young people. Notably, it is currently unclear how common these difficulties are in young people accessing treatment from child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). This would help us understand if services need to develop better ways of assessing and treating these problems in youth. The present study involves inserting a single mistrust questionnaire into routine service data collection in child and adolescent mental health services. This has four objectives. First, to assess levels of mistrust (paranoid thoughts/suspiciousness) in young people attending child and mental health services. Second, to assess the associations between mistrust and routine clinical measures. Third, for a subgroup of participants with available follow up data, we aim to assess the effect of paranoia on young peopleâs difficulties over time.

13,Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue,Inflammatory polyarthropathies,A Randomised Controlled Trial of Anakinra vs. Steroids for Gout Attacks in patients with Chronic Renal Disease (ASGARD): a Feasibility study,"Gout is a common condition that affects 1 in 40 people in the UK. It causes very painful ""attacks"" of joint swelling, redness and tenderness, mostly affecting the foot, ankle, knee, hand and wrist. It is very common in people with kidney disease, who also tend to be older people with other medical conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease and diabetes. We do not know the safest and best way to treat an attack of gout in these patients. A lot of people are given treatment that can worsen their kidney disease, along with their other medical conditions. We want to compare the safest treatment currently available, steroids, with a new treatment that is being increasingly used called Anakinra. This treatment stops the action of a chemical called interleukin-1 which has been discovered to play an important role in the acute gout attack. This treatment has already been used in a handful of patients with kidney disease. We feel it may be a better alternative to steroid treatment which can worsen diabetes, and blood pressure if used for a long time. We would like to perform a scientific study comparing these two treatments. This would involve a big expensive study requiring large numbers of patients and large amounts of information to be collected. Before we do a big study like this, we want to perform a small study using smaller numbers of patients. This will then give us information to plan a larger study to answer the question of which treatment may be better, safer and provides the most value for money for the NHS.","1.

2,Neoplasms,Malignant neoplasms of digestive organs,Establishing the diagnostic accuracy and acceptability of faecal immunochemical tests (FITs) to triage patients with lower abdominal symptoms for suspected colorectal cancer referrals in primary care: East of England Cancer Alliance FIT programme evaluation (FIT-East Study),"Bowel (colorectal) cancer, the fourth most common cancer in the UK, is second leading cause of death from cancer. It is difficult to make a timely diagnosis because the same symptoms occur with other conditions. The governmentâs guidance through the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), recommends that, if patients visit their local doctor with certain worrying symptoms, they should be referred urgently to hospital for further tests to look into the bowel using a narrow, flexible, telescopic camera (colonoscopy). However, many patients who have bowel cancer have other, more common symptoms such as change of toilet habit, weight loss or tiredness. New NICE guidance suggests a new test could be used for these people â the Faecal (poo) Immunochemical Test, or FIT. The FIT-poo test measures the amount of blood in a poo sample which may suggest bleeding in the bowel caused by cancer. But it is not known what amount of blood in a poo sample should lead to a colonoscopy for these patients. The new guideline uses the amount of blood found in patients sent urgently to hospital for a colonoscopy and amounts found in patients without problems who took part in bowel screening. These results may not apply to the patients with less worrying problems. Our study aims to find out how the FIT-poo test can help family doctors make decisions about patients with less worrying bowel problems. The study will guide decisions about which patients need to go to hospital for colonoscopy and which patients should stay under the care of their family doctor. We will also report on whether the FIT-poo test needs different cut-off levels for different patient groups, as well as whether the test is acceptable for patients and the local healthcare team of doctors, nurses and administration staff.","We will include all patients aged 40 years and over who are seen by their GP with possible symptoms of colorectal cancer, who do not meet the urgent referral criteria (NICE guideline NG12), and for whom the GP orders a FIT according to new NICE guideline DG30."
11,Diseases of the digestive system,Noninfective enteritis and colitis,IBD Reference and Biosimilar adalimumab CroSS over Study,"We are proposing to conduct a Phase IV, single-centre, prospective, randomised, single-blind, cross-over study. This study is using both a reference product (Humira-adalimumab) and a Biosimilar product (Imraldi-adalimumab). Biosimilars are biological medicines that were developed to be highly similar to the originator or reference medicines (in this case Humira) in terms of both efficacy (how well it works) and side effects, but offer the potential of lower treatment cost as compared to the originator molecule. This study will enrol subjects who are currently being treated with Humira. At the baseline visit subjects will be randomized to either continue on Humira for 24 weeks and then transition to receive Imraldi for a further 24 weeks or transition to Imraldi for 24 weeks and transition back to Humira for a further 24 weeks. As far as possible the study will mimic what would happen during a real-world cross over between reference product Humira and biosimilar Imraldi, and vice versa. Why? A study of this nature is required because physicians and health authorities are interested in real-world data, on effectiveness, safety and other outcomes, based on subject experience in the routine clinical setting. In particular, in a cost-constrained environment where non-medical transition between biosimilars and originators becomes an increasingly likely scenario, it is important to evaluate the transition process for outcome and safety measures. The primary objective is: To compare biosimilar Imraldi with Humira as assessed by maintenance of baseline clinical status at both 24 and 48 weeks after initiation of study therapy. We will also explore: 1. To describe subject clinical characteristics and disease status over time 2. To describe adalimumab and relevant concomitant medication use over time 3.

5,Mental and behavioural disorders,Mental and behavioural disorders due to psychoactive substance use,Telephone delivered Incentives for Encouraging adherence to Supervised methadone consumption: a feasibility study for a RCT of clinical and cost effectiveness (TIES).,"Most people in treatment for their addiction to heroin are prescribed methadone. However, individuals often fail to attend the pharmacy to take their methadone. Each missed dose is of concern as the patient will start to experience opiate withdrawal and cravings and will be more likely to use heroin. There is an urgent need to develop effective interventions for medication adherence. Research suggests that incentive-based medication adherence interventions may be very effective. The study aims to test the feasibility of conducting a future confirmatory trial evaluating the clinical and cost effectiveness of using telephone delivered incentives (praise and modest financial rewards) to encourage adherence with supervised consumption of methadone in community pharmacies. This study will use a cluster randomised controlled design. Three drug services (each with two community pharmacies supervising methadone consumption to 20 individuals) will be recruited and randomly allocated to receive i) telephone text message incentives, ii) telephone text message reminders or iii) no text message incentives or reminders. Acceptability, recruitment, follow-up, and suitable measures of clinical and cost effectiveness will be assessed.

15,"Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium",Complications of labour and delivery,Intradermal sterile water injections for relief of low back pain in labour: is a two injection technique as effective as a four injection technique? A pilot study.,"Sterile water injections (SWI) are a simple, safe procedure used to relieve low back pain in labouring women. The current technique involves four injections of sterile water in the lower back, which provides effective relief of low back pain. The injections, however, cause an intense stinging sensation, lasting about 30 seconds, which can sometimes discourage women from trying SWI, or using them again. To reduce the pain of administration, the injections are given simultaneously by two midwives. Unfortunately, this means that when there is not a second midwife available, SWI cannot be offered. The intention of the study is to explore if a two-injection technique provides as effective pain relief as four injections, whilst reducing the pain of administration. A pilot study is being undertaken to explore if the two-injection technique provides adequate analgesia, prior to a definitive trial. Anyone with an uncomplicated pregnancy, who is suffering with low back pain during the first stage of labour (up to 10cm dilated) can take part in the study. As long as the woman is beyond 37 weeks of pregnancy, and the labour is otherwise straightforward, they will be eligible to participate. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of three groups: two intervention groups and one control group. Participants will be asked to rate their level of low back pain from 1-10 prior to the injections (using the Visual Analogue Scale), and at set time periods afterwards, up to two hours.

9,Diseases of the circulatory system,"Diseases of veins, lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes, not elsewhere classified",CArvediloL versus variceal Band ligation in primary pREvention of variceal bleeding in liver cirrhosis,"Individuals with liver cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) can develop enlargement of veins in the gullet (food pipe) known as âoesophageal varicesâ. Patients with medium to large oesophageal varices have a 1 in 3 chance of these veins bleeding. In severe cases this could result in death. It is therefore important to lower the risk of this bleeding. At present all patients with medium to large oesophageal varices are offered one of two treatments to lower the risk of bleeding: Variceal banding A flexible tube (endoscope) with a miniature video camera and carrying a rubber ring is passed through the mouth to the gullet. An enlarged vein can be tied off with the rubber ring. Several (sometimes up to five) endoscopy sessions at approximately monthly intervals will be required to treat all of the varices. Subsequently, regular checks will be carried out at three, six then 12 months, then annually thereafter. Beta-blocker drugs Beta-blockers slow down the heart rate and lower blood pressure. These drugs are either carvedilol, propranolol. Carvedilol is used to treat high blood pressure and some forms of heart disease. Research studies have shown carvedilol to be also very effective and better than propranolol at lowering the pressure in varices in the gullet (the lower the pressure, the lower the risk of bleeding). Patients tolerating beta-blocker tablets will not require any more routine endoscopies to check on their varices. Some research studies suggest that banding may be more effective than beta-blockers in lowering the risk of variceal bleeding, but other studies suggest that this is not the case. However, all of these studies have been small and we still donât know what treatment is best.

7,Diseases of the eye and adnexa,Disorders of lens,Cohort study to quantify the effect of cataract on colour vision measurements using the Cambridge Colour Test,"Cataract is the leading cause of blindness in the world. A cataract is clouding of the normally clear lens of the eye that causes partial or total blindness. Modern microsurgical technique allows intervention for cataract, preventing long- term visual loss. Normal vision typically is restored with clear intraocular lens implantation. The development of cataract is usually a progressive process that is highly variable among individuals. Cataract formation typically is bilateral, although it is often asymmetrical. Patients usually complain of a problem with night driving, reading road signs, glare or difficulty with fine print. Given that patients often report cataract removal results in the perception of brighter colours and whiter whites, we hope to formally assess whether colour vision improves for the first time and quantify to what extent this occurs. Measuring the outcomes of cataract surgery has become even more important with the adoption of new surgical techniques, such as vitrectomy in younger patients, and other novel therapies. A more holistic understanding of outcome measures is required. In measuring and quantifying colour vision changes, we will be able to use this outcome measure to compare the efficacy of new treatments as well as validating patient experiences. We will be using a computerised test called the Cambridge Colour Test (CCT) in order to measure colour discrimination. CCT will be used to compare vision before and after cataract surgery. The CCT has been used in a variety of clinical studies and provides more information than the traditional colour arrangement tests. As a computer-controlled test, the CCT allows precise control over chromaticity parameters of the figure and the background and a staircase psychophysical procedure for estimating discrimination thresholds. This ensures a quantitative outcome that is sensitive to individual differences in normal colour vision but also distinguishes anomalous colour observers and their chromatic sensitivities.","The participant may enter the study if ALL of the following apply: â¢ Participant is willing & able to give informed consent for participation in the study. â¢ Male or female, aged 18 â 95. â¢ Able to participate in visual function testing. â¢ Participant is scheduled for a cataract operation as part of their routine care."
5,Mental and behavioural disorders,Mood [affective] disorders,fMRI investigation of the neural mechanisms of Emotional Cognitive Bias Modification as an adjunct therapy to SSRIs in depression.,"Recent studies indicate that pharmacotherapy for depression is ineffective in one-third to a half of patients. Furthermore, mounting evidence suggests that antidepressant drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SSRIs) work best in combination with psychological therapies. There is little work, however, to determine what the minimum effective psychological intervention may be in addition to drug treatment, and a similar lack of studies examining mechanisms of action of such adjunct therapies. Processing of emotional information is critical to social functioning but is disrupted in many psychiatric disorders, including Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). We aim to investigate whether a novel Emotional Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) psychological therapy that improves the way we see emotion in others could improve antidepressant drug efficacy. Specifically, we will deliver both online CBM training and SSRI pharmacotherapy in patients with a new episode of depression, to investigate whether this leads to changes in brain activity, assessed in an MRI scanner, that have been associated with improvements in mood in earlier work. Therapeutically, this combination of CBM and antidepressants has the potential to improve patient outcomes, and this study aims to investigate the mechanisms that may underlie this possibility.",â¢ Aged 18-55 years. â¢ Have a NEW or FIRST episode of depression (defined as not prescribed an antidepressant in the previous 6 months). â¢ Prescribed a course of sertraline medication. â¢ Score > 10 on the PHQ-9 assessment.

This project will address this need by examining peopleâs navigation via a smartphone app. Navigation is controlled by brain regions affected at the beginning of AD, and so it is hypothesised that altered navigational behaviour is an early sign of the disease. The ubiquitous use of smartphones offers a mean to embed diagnostics within everyday technologies. Location tracking technology is already widely used (global positioning systems, Google Maps). We have developed smartphone apps that are capable of tracking movements frequently, and this allows us to build up maps of peopleâs locations, and their movement between locations. These can then be analysed in terms of number of locations visited, paths taken between locations, efficiency of paths. The study will focus on two issues. First, given the wealth of information within peopleâs day to day movements, significant computer science-based modelling and data analysis will be needed to extract these measures of navigational behaviour. The second is that of preserving privacy. This will be achieved by removing all user-sensitive information from the data (put another way, we are interested in knowing how people get from A to B to C and back to A , but not in what A, B and C are).",Two groups of participants will be studied. 1. Healthy controls with no history of cognitive impairment. 2. People with mild cognitive impairment due to AD.
6,Diseases of the nervous system,Diseases of myoneural junction and muscle,Respiratory physiological changes following MIE (mechanical insufflation-exsufflation) in neuromuscular disease: Optimisation of pressure delivery,"This study aims to compare how the lung fills with air using three methods for clearing secretion(clearing mucus or phlegm from the airways), in order to determine the best way to clear secreations in patients with neuromuscular disease (NMD). Patients with NMD can suffer from a range of respiratory problems due to respiratory muscle weakness. Cough muscle weakness means secretion clearance from the airways can be problematic, and a source of infection. As a result, these patients are often supported with devices to aid clearance (such as mechanical insufflation-exsufflation, MIE) and reduce the risk of infection. Although evidence supports the use of these devices, the optimal technique or settings on the device are not clear. This study will have two cohorts. The first is in NMD patients with evidence of respiratory muscle weakness, who are stable.. The second will include patients with NMD who are admitted to the Lane Fox Unit or Critical Care at St. Thomasâ Hospital, with an acute deterioration in their respiratory function, requiring physiotherapy to aid their secretion clearance. The study protocol for both groups of patients will be the same. After being recruited into the study, they will undergo some simple non-invasive baseline measurements. They will then undergo three different methods of secretion clearance. Each method will last one hour, with 30 minutes between each method to allow the patient to rest. Throughout the testing stage, respiratory function will be monitored using non-invasive probes. Each patient will undergo approximately five hours of testing. The study will start in May 2016 and end in October 2016.","Study 1: - neuromuscular disease - respiratory muscle weakness (FVC<60%, snip<60%, sleep disordered breathing) - secretions or cough PEF<270 and history of LRTI - clinically stable for preceding 4 weeks (no changes to medications or ventilator settings) Study 2: - neuromuscular disease - respiratory muscle weakness (FVC<60%, snip<60%, sleep disordered breathing) - secretions or cough PEF<270 and history of LRTI - admitted with respiratory deterioration in the past 48 hours, and started on treatment for infection"
3,Diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs and certain disorders involving the immune mechanism,Haemolytic anaemias,Identification of Erythroid ProgenItor Defects in Critical IllnesS (EPICS): a prospective observational study,"At present, we have very few ways of determining which seriously ill patients in ICU will respond to treatment for anaemia (low number of red blood cells). This is important because red blood cells carry oxygen to vital body organs and reduced oxygen delivery can be detrimental. The answer may lie in being able to assess how well the cells in the bone marrow are working. These cells turn into specific blood cells such as red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout the body, white blood cells to fight infection and platelets to control bleeding. We are particularly interested in the development and function of red blood cells. In order to better understand the function of the bone marrow in ICU patients, samples have been collected by performing a bone marrow biopsy - an invasive procedure that is painful and carries a small risk of bleeding However, newly developed laboratory techniques mean that it is possible to understand bone marrow function from a blood test. These techniques are also able to assess how well these cells are able to develop into red blood cells. In other groups of patients, these techniques have been successful in characterising bone marrow function and shown promise in improving treatments for anaemia. In this study we wish to use these technique to better understand bone marrow function by recruiting 30 patients who have required ICU care for at least 3 days. We also wish to investigate what happens to bone marrow function after 1 month, whether or not it recovers and what factors (such as iron levels in the body) are associated with recovery. The findings of this research has the potential to help improve our understanding of erythropoiesis in critical illness and help identify which ICU patients are mostly likely to benefit from anaemia treatments.","(1) ICU patients (>/= 16 years old), both with capacity and without capacity (for medically induced reasons such as therapeutic sedation), who have required at least 72 hours of adult ICU care."
2,Neoplasms,Malignant neoplasms of digestive organs,"Urological and sexual function in males following robotic vs laparoscopic rectal surgery: An international, multicentre, randomised control trail","Urological and sexual dysfunction has been identified as a significant problem for patients following rectal surgery, which significantly affects the quality of life and psychological healing of survivors. Even though laparoscopic (keyhole) rectal surgery has been found to be superior to open surgery in terms of postoperative recovery, cosmetics and blood loss; itâs debatable whether it offers any improvement regarding urological and sexual function. Robotic surgery is a contemporary method of operating on patients requiring rectal surgery and may be a solution that overcomes this problem. Several current studies suggest that urological and sexual function might recover faster in male patients receiving robotic surgery. However, the evidence is limited, with studies lacking randomisation, being retrospective in nature and reporting small numbers of cases. A prospective, randomised control trial focusing on urogenital dysfunction with appropriate case numbers is required to establish whether robotic rectal surgery can reduce urological and sexual dysfunction. This study will involve three centres in the UK and one centre in Portugal. It is proposed that these centres shall recruit a sample population of all male patients requiring elective rectal surgery that shall be consented to take part in this research and will be randomised to receive either robotic or laparoscopic surgery for comparative analysis of urological and sexual dysfunction. Urological and sexual function will be assessed via self-reporting validated questionnaires that will be given to patients prior to randomisation and at three, six and 12 months following surgery. During the same time intervals, baseline urodynamic studies shall be conducted and their results analysed in order to assess urological dysfunction in an alternative way.","â¢ Patients with a diagnosis of rectal cancer (< = 15 cm from anal verge on MRI staging) amenable to curative surgery OR patients with ulcerative colitis having proctectomy and ileo-anal pouch â¢ Male â¢ > = 18 years old â¢ Able to provide written informed consent â¢ Fit enough to undergo minimally invasive surgery (ASA< = 3) â¢ Deemed suitable for minimally invasive surgery by local MDT â¢ Elective case â¢ Sexually active (this includes caressing, foreplay, masturbation and vaginal intercourse)"

This includes an ability to neutralise the activity of a wide range of proinflammatory mediators.1 In addition, there are now a number of clinical studies (outlined below) that have evaluated the beneficial effects of inhaled UFH in clinical intensive care unit (ICU) settings in burn patients and in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 2,3,4,5 and emphasises the importance of using systemic low molecular weight heparin as an anticoagulant in COVID-19 infected patients, which should be given early in treatment. 6 There is preliminary clinical evidence from China that systemic heparin has shown some benefit at reducing the impact of COVID-19 in critically ill patients.4,5,6 In addition, several other studies in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive airways disease have shown a reduction in ventilator free days following inhaled UFH (25,000 IU). 2,8,9 Additionally, clinical benefit has been observed in patients with COPD following inhaled UFH at doses up to 75,000IU twice daily (bid). 10,3 Notably none of these studies have reported any adverse effects from bleeding following inhaled UFH, suggesting this may be a relatively safe way of treating COVID-19 patients. The potential anti-viral effects of inhaled UFH, were previously reviewed. 1 Critically, UFH inhibits the binding of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein to the specific angiotensin converting enzyme receptor-2 (ACE-2) receptor. 11 ACE-2 facilitates viral entry into target cells12 and is expressed in pulmonary alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells.13 Additionally, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are an attractive target for viruses because of their wide spread distribution on the surface of most human cells, where the initial interactions with viruses occur.14 Multiple studies have provided evidence that UFH competes with heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPG) for binding to surface proteins on viruses, including types of coronavirus, and limits their adhesion to cellular targets and thus their infectivity. 14 In patients with SARS-CoV-2 airway infection, it was found that sputum samples retain SARS-CoV-2 for 39 days after throat swabs are negative. 15 Therefore, the mucolytic effects of inhaled UFH are also likely to improve clearance of virus from the airways. The purpose of this study is to investigate the therapeutic effects and safety of inhaled UFH in patients with COVID-19 as there are currently no vaccines, no effective medicines, and only symptomatic treatments available.

17,"Congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities",Congenital malformations of the circulatory system,Heart Disease in Pregnancy - Maternal Cardiovascular Adaptation and Fetal Outcomes,"Heart disease in pregnancy is the single largest cause of indirect maternal deaths in the UK. The high maternal mortality rate due to heart disease remained unchanged from 2009-2013 and addressing it remains a major challenge for the UK health service. The number and disease complexity of congenital heart disease survivors continues to grow and obstetricians need to be able to manage such women safely. In low-risk pregnancies, the cardiovascular system (the heart and the vessel network of the body) undergoes a series of physiological changes to meet the increased metabolic demands of the mother and the fetus. There are limited data on the adaptation of the heart in women with congenital heart disease and little is known about the reversibility of these changes after pregnancy. Research in this field is therefore of high priority. Women with congenital heart disease are also known to deliver small babies. It is yet to be established if this is a consequence of poor adaptation of the cardiovascular system to pregnancy or if there is an underlying problem with the placenta caused by the heart disease itself. Our aim is to study the adaptation of the cardiovascular system to pregnancy in women with congenital heart disease but also in women without any heart disease and in women whose babies are found to be small during pregnancy. To do this, we plan to see the three groups of women at different points of their pregnancy and check their blood pressure and saturations and perform a scan and a reading of their heart using electrodes. These tests would be conducted at rest and after a short period of exercise on a stationary bike. We would also perform scans of their babies to monitor the growth and blood flow and take blood samples and samples from the placenta after birth.",Part 1 - Able to provide informed consent - Women of reproductive age: 18 to 60 years-old from one of the three groups below: - Women with congenital heart disease planning a pregnancy or carrying a singleton pregnancy at any gestation - Low-risk women who are planning a pregnancy or carrying a singleton pregnancy at any gestation - Women whose singleton pregnancy has been complicated by fetal growth restriction - FGR - at any gestation Part 2 - Having participated in Part 1 of the study - Consent to participate in Part 2 of the study - FGR detected during index pregnancy

Participants will be recruited from the specialist outpatient hepatology clinic at Kings College Hospital NHS Trust who are either being seen as a new or follow-up patient. Participants will be treated and assessed in line with the normal clinical care pathway. Autoimmune hepatitis is relatively rare, with a prevalence of about 8,000 people in the UKâ diagnosed. It is a non-resolving liver condition that is usually treated with a combination of corticosteroid and immunosuppressant therapy. The current standard for effective management requires close monitoring of disease activity to balance disease control and unwanted side effects of treatmentâ. The recommended management involves monthly blood tests and annual liver biopsies to verify histological remissionâ. However, blood tests lack sensitivity and biopsy is very invasive and samples only a small portion of the liverâ. Indeed, liver biopsy remains the gold standard for evaluating liver pathology, however it is not appropriate for longitudinal monitoring due to pain, risk and invasiveness. Blood tests can identify when the liver is inflamed, but are insensitive to small changes and are not prognostic. There is a significant unmet need in this patient group relating to both disease monitoring and identifying those needing higher immunosuppression or transplant. Non-invasive, quantitative MRI can characterise liver tissue to aid in the diagnosis of liver disorders. Using quantitative MRI in the management of AIH patients could be an invaluable asset within the standard care pathway to ensure more appropriate and accurate dosing of steroids is used in AIH patients, thus preventing liver failure.",- Adult patients aged 18 years or over - Patient due to attend the hepatology clinic for AIH diagnostics/review - Participant is willing and able to give informed consent
5,Mental and behavioural disorders,Unspecified mental disorder,Psychological factors predicting clinical outcome following bariatric surgery,"Obesity is a major cause of death and disability. It is associated with many other conditions including diabetes, heart problems, breathing problems, joint disease, reflux, liver disease, infertility and cancer. Weight loss surgery is currently the most effective treatment for obesity and leads to a reduction in the risk of death and improvement in associated conditions. However, there is variability in how well those undergoing surgery respond, both in terms of weight loss and improvement in co-morbidities. It is known that psychological factors play an important role in a person's response to surgery and that many patients undergoing surgery face or, have faced, psychological problems. This study investigates whether you can predict a patient's response to bariatric surgery by analysing pre-operative psychological data and correlating it to data on clinical outcome, collected as part of routine NHS care.",Male and females who have undergone bariatric surgery within Imperial Weight Centre Above age 18 years
1,Certain infectious and parasitic diseases,Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] disease,Advancing Assessment of Episodic Disability to Enhance Healthy Ageing among Adults Living with HIV: Developing a Short-Form HIV Disability Questionnaire (SF-HDQ) for use in Clinical Practice,"Background: Individuals with HIV are living longer and ageing with the increasing complexity of physical, mental and social health-related consequences of HIV and multimorbidity, known as disability. We developed a 69-item Patient Reported Outcome (PRO), the HIV Disability Questionnaire (HDQ) to measure the presence, severity and episodic nature of disability experienced by people living with HIV: across 6 domains: physical; cognitive; mental and emotional; uncertainty; difficulties with day-to-day; and challenges to social inclusion. We demonstrated that the HDQ possesses sensibility, reliability (consistency) and validity (measures what it is supposed to measure) among adults living with HIV in Canada, Ireland, United Kingdom, and the United States. However, to date the HDQ has been used primarily in the context of research, with little uptake in clinical practice due to cited concerns of time restrictions. There is a critical need for a brief, yet comprehensive assessment of disability for adults ageing with HIV that can be routinely administered across health system settings and clinical practice. Study Purpose: To develop and pilot the implementation of a short-form HIV-specific disability questionnaire to identify disability across clinical settings, in order to promote healthy aging among adults with HIV. Study objectives: 1. Develop and assess the utility of a new short-form HIV-specific disability questionnaire across multiple clinical practice settings with older adults living with HIV. 2. To pilot the implementation of the new short-form HIV-specific disability questionnaire, and assess its measurement properties while collecting foundational data on the presence, severity and episodic nature of disability among adults aging with HIV and multimorbidity in the United Kingdom, Canada, Ireland, and the United States.","Adults Living with HIV: - Adults (18 years of age or older) living with HIV willing and able to provide written informed consent to participate in the study.

13,Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue,Other soft tissue disorders,Models of Nociceptive Plasticity in Chronic Pain (MoNoPly),"Many patients with musculoskeletal disorders (e.g. arthritis, AR; fibromyalgia, FM) suffer severe pain that, for a number of possible reasons, is poorly managed with drugs or surgery. It is thought that in some cases, changes in brain structure and function (""neuroplasticity"") may contribute to pain and treatment resistance. Such changes can occur in response to how the brain processes sensations such as pain (nociception). New technologies are needed to detect these changes and to target treatment appropriately. We aim to test new methods for detecting pain-related changes in the brain. We will investigate whether differences between individuals in brain structure and function, and how the brain processes pain, can be understood in terms of mathematical models describing the mechanisms by which the brain learns and adapts to pain sensing (nociception) over time â a phenomenon we term ânociceptive learningâ. This will involve comparing a number of mathematical models of nociceptive learning and associated brain changes to see which provides the best explanation (according to the statistics of the modelling) of participantsâ perception of pain and of their brain structure and function. We will also seek preliminary evidence of clinical validity, asking whether these models can differentiate individuals into clinically meaningful subgroups. If successful, future projects will evaluate the clinical utility of the findings, which we envisage will fall into two categories: 1. an improved ability to detect mechanisms of chronic pain for treatment stratification/optimisation; 2. new knowledge about the contribution of brain changes to chronic pain that can be used to improve the educational aspects of multi-disciplinary treatment.","All participants â¢ Age above 18 years â¢ Willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the study Arthritis participants â¢ Clinically significant pain of greater than 3 months duration, evidenced by the fact that they have consulted for treatment for pain symptoms in secondary Fibromyalgia participants â¢ Clinically significant pain of greater than 3 months duration, evidenced by the fact that they have consulted for treatment for pain symptoms in secondary care. â¢ Have participated in the 16-day Pain Management Programme at the Walton Centre.

11,Diseases of the digestive system,Diseases of liver,"An open label, non-randomised, prospective, single arm trial, using normothermic machine liver perfusion NMLP to test viability and transplantation of marginal livers","Liver transplantation is a highly successful form of treatment for many forms of end-stage liver disease. However, there is currently a shortage of livers for patients on the Liver Transplant Waiting List. This inevitably means that up to 20% of patients waiting for a liver transplant die or are removed from the list due to poor health, whilst waiting for a suitable organ. In order to respond to this shortage, clinicians are using organs that would previously not have been used for transplantation, for example from older donors or from non-heart beating donors. This study uses a technique called a normothermic machine liver perfusion (NMLP), where the liver is placed onto a machine prior to transplantation. Oxygenated blood, medications and other fluids are circulated through the liver at 37C. We have identified criteria that we believe indicate whether a liver is functioning. In this study we will be using a NMLP machine called the OrganOx metraÂ® to evaluate the function of livers that have been rejected for transplantation. If the liver meets these criteria the liver will be transplanted into a consented suitable recipient. This study is designed to demonstrate the potential of normothermic machine liver perfusion (NMLP) to not only increase the donor pool by transplanting livers which would have previously been rejected for clinical use, but also to improve patient safety by reducing or removing the likelihood of a liver failing to function after transplantation.","Graft Inclusion Criteria Donor liver graft must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be considered / eligible for inclusion in the VITTAL trial: 1.

11,Diseases of the digestive system,Diseases of liver,The Gut-Liver Axis in liver disease and liver transplantation,"Patients with both acute and chronic liver failure are at risk of sepsis and multiple organ failure. Similarly patients with sepsis are at risk of development of liver dysfunction with escape of endotoxin produced by bacteria that reside in their intestines, which becomes 'leakier'. Gut dysfunction is defined by changes in the types of bacteria within the gut and in overall 'leakiness' allowing bacterial products which would otherwise be contained within the gut to travel into the bloodstream and lymphatic system and have detrimental effects elsewhere in the body. This passage of bacterial products is defined as bacterial translocation, and their effects on the liverÂ­related and general immune system can be then be measured. This study aims to investigate the role of gut dysfunction and its impact on bacterial translocation and immune system dysfunction in individuals with a range of acute and chronic liver failure syndromes and sepsis, as well as those undergoing operative procedures such as liver transplantation, liver resection and placement on cardiopulmonary bypass at time of cardiac surgery. This may allow in the future for therapeutic strategies which may improve outcome, particularly intervening within the gut to prevent bacterial translocation. There is evidence emerging to suggest that the leakiness of the gut is affected by gut microbe activity. These trillions of organisms within the gut lumen are very diverse, affected by multiple factors including liver disease, and help control chemical reactions related to digestion and absorption of nutrients. The chemical byproducts of these reactions often appear in the urine or blood where they can be detected by techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This powerful window on metabolism allows us to clearly see which chemical pathways are abnormal in the patients we are studying, providing biomarkers for diagnosis and potential sites for intervention and treatment.","LIVER FAILURE GROUP â¢ AoCLF: Patients with chronic liver disease (cirrhosis) that suffer an acute decompensation in their liver function following an acute insult (e.g. infection) resulting in organ dysfunction.

5,Mental and behavioural disorders,Unspecified mental disorder,Complete smokefree policies in mental health inpatient settings: exploring the impact on smoking behaviour and the role of electronic cigarettes,"Tobacco smoking is one of the leading preventable causes of death in the UK. Smoking prevalence in those with a mental illness is in excess of three times that of the general population (40-80% vs 16%), substantially increasing risks of smoking-related mortality. Resultantly, NICE recommends that all mental health settings be entirely smokefree, with no smoking breaks facilitated and evidence-based treatment for temporary abstinence and smoking cessation made available to patients. Implementation approaches and support offered to smokers, however, varies across trusts, with the extent and likely impact of this is unknown. A recent CRUK funded evaluation of the impact of policy implementation raised two primary questions 1) How does admission to a smokefree mental health treatment ward change patientsâ smoking behaviour and attitudes during and after the inpatient stay? 2) What is the role of electronic cigarettes in the implementation of smokefree policies in mental health inpatient settings? This study aims to answer these questions by interviewing inpatients from 6 mental health wards across three NHS trusts in Yorkshire. A sample of 104 eligible patients (over 18 years old, reported to be a tobacco smoker on admission, capacity to provide informed study consent) will be recruited over a four-month period, completing questionnaires at three time points: 1) on the ward after admission, 2) approximately 1 week after discharge, and 3) 1 month after discharge. Questionnaire questions will collect information about participant demographics, cigarette consumption (Heaviness of Smoking Index), strength of urges to smoke, motivation to stop smoking, smoking-related support offered and accepted during admission and after discharge, electronic cigarette use, and experiences of and suggestions for improving smoking-related support.

2,Neoplasms,"Malignant neoplasms of ill-defined, secondary and unspecified sites",Communication about tests and referral to investigate causes of ill health (Catric Study 2),"The threshold for urgent investigation (tests) for cancer has been lowered with the hope of improving early diagnosis of cancer. As a result more patient may be referred to specialists or offered tests. Most of these patents will not have cancer, however being offered investigation may cause concern. Furthermore, cancer is not always discussed by doctors with patients when referring them for tests in response to symptoms that may suggest cancer and very little is known about the information needs of these patients. This study aims to explore the consultation experience, GP communication and referrals, information needs and concerns of patients with suspected cancer. 80 doctor appointments in primary care, with patients who meet the criteria for investigation of suspected cancer will be video-recorded and some of these patients will also be interviewed about their information needs, their understanding of what was said in the consultation, any cancer concerns, and the extent to which their information needs and concerns were addressed. To achieve 80 recordings with patients who meet the criteria for investigation of suspected cancer, we will need to video-record up to 500 doctor appointments in primary care. We estimate that 200 recordings will come from patients recruited through triage who present NICE cancer referral symptoms (to provide 50-70 patients referred for recommended tests/specialist referral). We will also record up to 300 unselected patients (to provide 10-15 patients referred for recommended tests/specialist referral). By linking our analyses of video-recordings with what patients say in interviews we will develop recommendations for GP-patient communication about referral, and investigation of suspected cancer.

19,"Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes",Injuries to the head,Language Processing After Trauma Cohort Study,"Each day, ten individuals across the United Kingdom enter a coma as a result of a blow to the head (also known as a traumatic brain injury, or TBI). Patients in coma are unresponsive to external stimulation and breathe with support from a mechanical ventilator. A significant proportion of coma survivors will develop a prolonged disorder of consciousness (PDOC), such as the vegetative state, in which they appear to be awake but show no signs of being aware of themselves or of their environments. However, if a patient with a PDOC is able to move in response to verbal commands (e.g. âGive me a thumbs-upâ) they are considered to be at least minimally conscious. Once this ability has been identified, rehabilitation can focus on training the individual to use this action to communicate (e.g. âThumbs-up for yesâ). More accurate methods for predicting the level of recovery after coma are required. Electroencephalography, or EEG, is a portable form of brain-imaging that records the tiny electrical signals generated by the brain via a series of electrodes placed on the scalp. By measuring the brainâs response to external stimuli, it may be possible to improve the accuracy of prognosis in coma (i.e. predicted level of recovery). We will test the predictive power of EEG responses to speech in a group of post-traumatic patients recovering from coma who do not immediately regain consciousness after withdrawal of sedation. During the year after this assessment, we will determine each patientâs level of recovery through interviews and, in some cases, a further EEG assessment and multiple behavioural assessments. The more accurate methods of prognosis that come from this research will result in more appropriate provision of limited rehabilitation resources post-coma, thereby reducing healthcare costs. This research is funded by the UK Medical Research Council (MRC).","To be included in this study, the participant should be: 1. Aged 18 years or older 2. Receiving care at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital as a result of a traumatic brain injury. 3. Scoring less than 9 on the Glasgow Coma Score at the time of recruitment."
11,Diseases of the digestive system,Other diseases of intestines,EDMONd â A feasibility study of Elemental Diet as an alternative to parenteral nutrition for patients with inoperable Malignant bowel Obstruction,"The aim of this study is to determine whether elemental diet (a type of drink that contains an elemental protein source known as amino acids) can be tolerated by patients with inoperable bowel blockage who can no longer eat and are only able to swallow small amount of fluid. The objective is to find out whether elemental diet (ED) can be used as an acceptable nutrition and whether it improves the quality of life. Bowel blockage is a common complication in patients with ovarian cancer. Unfortunately when the cancer is advanced, this blockage can occur in many parts of the bowel therefore surgery is not possible. Every year in the UK there are around 7000 new cases of ovarian cancer and a very large proportion of patients develop bowel blockage, some publications report the rate as high as 50% . One way to feed patients with bowel blockage is through the veins; this is known as parenteral nutrition (PN) however PN is rarely used in UK. Patients with malignant bowel blockage are often able to swallow small amounts of liquid but if they have no PN they are only able to survive for 2-3 weeks and the psychological as well as physical impact on patients and the family are very distressing. ED is a type of a drink which contains an elemental protein source known as amino acids. ED drinks are almost totally absorbed in the upper part of the bowel and therefore could be absorbed even in patients who have bowel blockage which usually develops lower down in the gut. If this study is successful and proves that ED can be tolerated and provide nutrition to patients with inoperable bowel blockage it will be a big step towards improving the quality of life at the final stage of cancer.",Age > 18 years Confirmed inoperable bowel obstruction due to disseminated malignancy Ability to tolerate 500 ml of liquid Capacity to give informed consent

6,Diseases of the nervous system,Diseases of myoneural junction and muscle,"A phase Ib, open label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of multiple ascending oral doses of Rimeporide in patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy","This study examines the safety and tolerability and effects on the muscles of a new drug, rimeporide, in boys aged 6 to 14 years with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), a rare hereditary disorder for which new treatments are urgently needed. In DMD there is an imbalance between the levels of calcium and sodium in the muscles cells which is thought to be important in the damage which occurs overtime. Rimeporide has a positive effect on the levels of sodium and calcium in the muscle cells, by blocking an important protein called NHEÂ¬-1, hoped to slowing of the progressive loss of strength of the muscles. Results of studies in animals have been encouraging and the drug has been granted designation as an Orphan Drug in Europe. Rimeporide has been given already to 145 healthy adult volunteers and 21 adult patients with heart failure and so far appears well tolerated. However, before large-scale tests of rimeporide in DMD can be conducted it is necessary to examine the safety and tolerability in children with DMD. The study will enrol 20 patients with DMD, aged 6 to 14 years. 4 dose levels will be tested, with 5 patients taking the drug at each dose level. Treatment at the each level can only commence if safety at the lower level is judged satisfactory. Each patient will receive rimeporide for 4 weeks and the patients will be followed up for an additional two weeks after the last dose of rimeporide. Treatment will be administered orally three times daily. Patients will be carefully followed up for safety and will attend the study centre on 4 occasions. Effects on biomarkers of DMD will be explored, including optional assessment by nuclear magnetic resonance techniques conducted at the Institute of Myology in Paris.",1.

4,"Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases",Diabetes mellitus,Promoting physical activity through group self-management support for those with multimorbidity: a randomised controlled trial,"MAP is a randomised controlled trial which evaluates the effectiveness of a structured education programme designed to help people with two or more long-term health conditions. Having more than one long-term health condition significantly impacts on quality of life and health care. In developed countries 25 to 55% of the population at 60 years and 80% of those over 75 years of age are diagnosed with multiple chronic conditions. The study aims to address the gap in health care services for the effective delivery of a self-management programme for patients with two or more long term conditions. Patients who have multiple chronic illnesses will be recruited to the study from primary and secondary care settings in Leicester and Leicestershire. They will be randomised either to a control or to an intervention group. Participants in the intervention group will attend a bespoke group education programme. The programme will focus on factors related to personalised health-related behaviours. It will aim to enhance physical activity and confidence in patients with chronic conditions, promote medication adherence and reduce frailty.","Patients will be included if they meet the following criteria â¢ Good understanding in written and verbal English; â¢ Ability to give informed consent; â¢ 40-85 years old inclusive; â¢ Have two or more of the following chronic conditions: Secondary prevention of coronary heart disease; Peripheral arterial disease; Atrial fibrillation disease; Heart failure; Hypertension; Stroke/TIA (Transient Ischaemic Attack); Asthma; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Chronic kidney disease; Diabetes mellitus; Hypothyroidism; Depression; Osteoporosis; Rheumatoid arthritis; â¢ Have access to a mobile phone for use in potential study activities; â¢ Able to walk independently; .There are no limitations with disease duration, medication use and/or initiation of new treatment unless there are specific recommendation for bed rest and minimising physical activity for a specific condition."
5,Diseases of the circulatory system,Other forms of heart disease,Feasibility study of the use of point-of-care NP measurement in primary care in patients with heart failure,"Heart failure is a condition where the heart does not pump blood around the body as well as it should. Although it is called heart âfailureâ, the heart is still working, but it might need extra help to make sure it works as well as it can. When someone has been diagnosed with heart failure, they are regularly monitored by their health care team. A blood test for natriuretic peptide (NP) is+C2 sometimes used to help diagnose heart failure, and there is some research that shows that monitoring NP may also be useful for monitoring patients with heart failure. It is possible for a doctor or nurse to measure NP from a blood sample themselves with a special machine (a âpoint of careâ test), instead of sending it to a laboratory. This means that they get the result quickly, which would be important if they want to use it to make a decision about whether to change someoneâs treatment, or to send them to hospital. We want to see if itâs practical for a GP or nurse to use this quick blood test to monitor patients with heart failure during their normal care. The study will involve around 30 patients, and we will ask them to make three extra visits to their GP practice over a year to have the quick blood test, along with some laboratory blood tests and a general check of their heart health. We will also see if it is practical for the quick blood test to be used if they come to see someone (a GP or nurse) during that year for about their heart failure.","â¢ Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the study. â¢ Male or female, aged 18 years or above. â¢ Confirmed diagnosis of heart failure made by cardiologist and/or echocardiography â¢ Currently managed in a primary care setting where the clinician is willing to take part in routine point-of-care NP monitoring."

11,Diseases of the digestive system,Noninfective enteritis and colitis,Early measurement of faecal calprotectin as a predictor of primary non-response to treatment in paediatric Crohnâs disease: a pilot study,"Testing stool for markers of inflammation has boosted our ability to diagnose inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) early in children. While effective treatments exist, some children need to try several different types before they find one that works for them. This has an adverse effect on their quality of life, and risks the development of complications. A simple test that could determine whether or not a treatment was working soon after it was started would allow clinicians to identify which children need to be put onto stronger treatments earlier. We propose that the same tests of inflammation in stool used for diagnosis could be used for this purpose, and that parents could collect specimens at home and post them to a laboratory, thereby minimising the testingâs impact on family life. By testing this approach in a relatively small number of children with IBD we will generate essential data that could be accessed by all researchers to help them identify ways to get children with IBD onto the best personalised treatment for them as quickly as possible. We will follow 100 children with newly diagnosed IBD from participating NHS hospitals (200 children will be prospectively recruited prior to diagnostic endoscopy). Families will be asked to post anonymised stool samples to a central laboratory at five timepoints: Before scheduled endoscopy (performed for clinical reasons to confirm diagnosis), and at 14, 28, 42, and 56 days following initiation of treatment. The study involves no alteration to standard care based on clinical need, no additional visits to hospital, and no invasive sampling.

18,"Symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified",General symptoms and signs,Long-term opioids in women with musculoskeletal pain in primary care and associated sexual dysfunction: A cross-sectional survey.,"22% of primary care attendees suffer with chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP), 12-13% are prescribed opioids. Musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions are a leading cause of CNCP and account for 1 in 7 primary care consultations in the United Kingdom (UK). Since the 1980âs there has been an increase in opioid prescribing for CNCP. Adverse effects are common with up to 80% of those taking opioids affected by at least one. Long-term opioid use can lead to reproductive dysfunction in men (low libido, impotence) and in women taking illegal opioids but evidence is limited in prescribed opioids. A recent systematic review found a small amount of evidence that supported a possible relationship between long-term prescribed opioid use in women and reproductive and sexual dysfunction. A CPRD cohort study in women found an increased risk of menopausal symptoms and abnormal menstruation in long-term (> 90 days) opioid users with MSK conditions, but low numbers of women with low libido when compared with population estimates, suggesting a different approach is needed to investigate this in future research. We intend to investigate the prevalence of low libido in women receiving opioids for MSK pain and compare the prevalence between those receiving short-term and long-term opioids. We intend to undertake a cross-sectional postal survey of women aged 18-45 years old who are prescribed opioids for MSK pain. Participants will be identified from General Practices within the West Midlands Clinical Research Network. We will send a single postal survey to 1000 women, with two follow up mailings for non-responders. We will also ask for consent to review anonymised medical records for past medical history, medication use and previously recorded reproductive or sexual problems.

It is a chronic and potentially disabling disease that represents a major public health and clinical concern. The number of patients diagnosed with T1D each year is increasing and is approaching an epidemic level in some countries that track this information The POInT study examines whether the development of T1D can be prevented in children with an increased risk of T1D through preventive treatment with insulin. Infants who have a high risk of developing type 1 diabetes will be identified in the INGR1D screening study and will then be invited to take part in the POInT study. In POInT, insulin will be given to children aged between 4-7 months every day until their 3rd birthday to see if it reduces the incidence of diabetes in childhood. The insulin will be given orally (via mouth) as a powder and is not used to lower blood glucose levels. Instead, it serves to train and regulate the immune system.","1.

11,Diseases of the digestive system,Other diseases of the digestive system,Saliva to Predict rIsk of disease using Transcriptomics and epigenetics (SPIT),"There are numerous lifestyle-altering diseases in the UK for which patients undergo invasive tests before a diagnosis can be made. These tests are often uncomfortable and inconvenient for patients, and very costly for the NHS. They typically involve a degree of risk to patients (e.g. bleeding and bowel rupture during endoscopy; or harmful radiation exposure from CT scanning). Many of these tests yield normal results, since only a small percentage of patients being investigated actually have the disease in question. This study will focus on using analysis of symptoms, risk factors and saliva samples to predict patientsâ risk of developing various diseases. The research process will involve identifying patients who are already known to have certain diseases, plus those who are awaiting investigations to confirm those diseases. We will explain the study to patients, after which we will use a questionnaire to obtain information regarding their symptoms and risk factors for the disease. We will then collect saliva and blood samples from the patient, and when appropriate, obtain tissue samples during investigations that they are already scheduled to undergo as part of their treatment. No additional procedures will be performed on these patients, and their clinical treatment will not be affected in any way. We will perform complex genetic analysis on these samples to see if the characteristics of the patientsâ saliva can accurately predict the disease in their tissues. Once we have confirmed this accuracy, we aim to create a cheap, portable and quick bedside test that uses patientsâ saliva to predict their risk of disease, so that only high-risk patients can be scheduled to undergo further investigations. This will save the NHS and other healthcare systems worldwide significant amounts of money and resources, while saving patients time and inconvenience, and reducing their risk of complications from unnecessary investigations.","Inclusion criteria for colorectal cancer study 1.

5,Mental and behavioural disorders,Unspecified mental disorder,Observations of multidisciplinary care planning meetings,"Multidisciplinary care planning meetings (also known as multidisciplinary team meetings, or MDTs) are central to the management of chronic disease, and as such they have become widely established across the NHS and internationally. This has occurred as a result of increasingly specialised care, complex medical knowledge, continuing clinical uncertainty and promotion of patient involvement in their own care. While multidisciplinary care planning meetings have many benefits, they are resource-intensive, requiring time away from other clinical commitments. As such, it is essential that their structure, process and quality of decision-making be maximized so that they can deliver value to the NHS and patients. When compared to other chronic diseases, such as cancer, dementia and heart failure, mental health teams were found to implement fewer treatment plan decisions, and team members reported that meetings lacked clarity and purpose. More recently, some guidance for MDTs in mental health has been provided in a report by the Health Services and Delivery Research, which laid out 21 indicators of good practice, including regular yearly audits to check that meetings are achieving their goals. In addition, there have been calls for empirical research on MDT meeting decision-making in routine practice to understand how and under what conditions they produce effective decisions. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to contribute to the overall body of knowledge using ethnographic observations of multidisciplinary care planning meetings within the mental health setting at Broadmoor Hospital and City and Hackney Centre. Specifically, this project will qualitatively assess the decision-making process. Observation notes will be scrutinised to identify common themes, which will be organised into a coding frame.","All participants in the study will be NHS staff who are members of a multidisciplinary team. They will all be over 18 years of age and be able to speak, read and write fluent English. Also, since patients sometimes attend care planning meetings, they will also be included in the study."

It can also be expensive for them. If patients miss their appointments, it costs the NHS money and may affect their treatment outcome, making their condition harder to manage. If patients are able to have their check-ups (follow-up appointments) with their medical team without going to the hospital, this could improve patient experience and outcomes, as well as helping the NHS run more effectively. The project aims to find out if patients who are receiving treatment for chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) would find it acceptable to have their follow-up appointments using web-based video calling. This will be done by conducting interviews with individual patients treated by University College London Hospital (UCLH) and also by running a focus (discussion) group(s) with patients who receive treatment elsewhere so we can compare the opinions of UCLH patients with those of the wider CML population. Patients will be asked for their opinions about: what they feel they need at follow-up consultations and the use of web-based video consultations for their follow-ups with their doctor, nurse and/or pharmacist instead of at the hospital. They will also complete a questionnaire about their current model of follow-up consultations. Patients will be at least 18 years old, and will have received treatment for CML for at least 12 months. They will have consented to take part. Patients will be identified with the support of Bloodwise, CML Support, any other CML related support groups/charities and the UCLH CML Care Team.

11,Diseases of the digestive system,Other diseases of the digestive system,The role of faecal bile acids in the management of bile acid diarrhoea.,"Background: The prevalence of chronic diarrhoea is 5% of the population, a third of these cases have bile acid malabsorption (BAM). SeHCAT testing is the gold standard for BAM, and involves the ingestion of seleno-tauro-homocholic acid, which is limited to a small number of UK centres. NICE reported that although SeHCAT might benefits patients, there was a need to explore alternative technologies. With limited access to and cost of SeHCAT, many centres use an empirical trial of bile acid sequestrants, without a diagnosis. This may not be effective as many patients are non-adherent. Aim: This pilot study will evaluate a cheaper and simpler laboratory test, which quantitates faecal bile acids. This assay is safer, easier to use, and potentially gives a rapid diagnosis in BAM. The aim is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of this new assay. In the longitudinal phase of this study, further evaluate of faecal bile acids following bile salt sequestrant therapy, will evaluate its role in dose titration. Methods: We will recruit patients (i) post-cholecystectomyÍ¾ (ii) post-terminal ileal resectionÍ¾ or (iii) primary BAM. Patients will have SeHCAT testing and the faecal bile acid concentration will be determined. Outcomes: We will compare the results of faecal bile acid measurement in these patients with SeHCAT to determine its sensitivity and specificity. Longitudinal follow up will determine the effect of bile salt sequestration on faecal bile acids. These results would inform the design of larger studies, allowing us to evaluate this new test in the NHS.",Eligibility Inclusion criteria a. Age > 18 years b. Willing to provide informed consent c.

4,"Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases",Disorders of other endocrine glands,Dissecting androgen excess and metabolic dysfunction for an integrated systems approach to polycystic ovary syndrome through the assessment of detailed phenome and metabolome data,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 10% of all women and usually presents with irregular menstrual periods and difficulties conceiving. However, PCOS is also a lifelong metabolic disorder and affected women have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Increased blood levels of male hormones, also termed androgens, are found in most PCOS patients. Androgen excess appears to impair the ability of the body to respond to the sugar-regulating hormone insulin (=insulin resistance). We found that fat tissue of PCOS patients overproduces androgens and that this can result in a build-up of toxic fat, which increases insulin resistance and could cause liver damage. In a large cohort of women registered in a GP database, we have found that androgen excess increases the risk of fatty liver disease. We aim to identify those women with PCOS who are at the highest risk of developing metabolic disease, which would allow for early detection and potentially prevention of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, fatty liver and cardiovascular disease. We will assess clinical presentation, androgen production and metabolic function in women with PCOS to use similarities and differences in these parameters for the identification of subsets (=clusters) of women who are at the highest risk of metabolic disease. We will do this by using a standardised set of questions to scope PCOS-related signs and symptoms and the patientâs medical history and measure body composition and blood pressure. This standardised recording of a patientâs clinical presentation (=clinical phenotype) is called Phenome analysis. We will collect blood and urine samples for the systematic measurement of steroid hormones including a very detailed androgen profile (=steroid metabolome analysis) and of thousands of substances produced by human metabolism (=global metabolome analysis). Phenome and metabolome data will then undergo integrated computational analysis for the detection of clusters predictive of metabolic risk.",The following inclusion criteria need to be met for DAISy-PCOS Phenome Study participants: â¢ Women with a suspected diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome â¢ Age range 18-70 years â¢ Ability to provide informed consent

13,Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue,Inflammatory polyarthropathies,Pilot study to assess faecal and serum biomarkers as potential nonÂ­invasive inflammatory markers in pregnancy and inflammatory bowel disease.,"In pregnancy traditional blood markers of inflammation are elevated related to pregnancy and cannot be used to assess disease activity. Knowing whether there is active disease that requires the introduction of medication that have potential to harm the foetus or success of pregnancy is very important. Currently physicians have to rely on symptoms, which can be very variable or on endosocpic assessment. This inspection of the bowel with a camera also carries risk to the unborn foetus and is not recommended until the second trimester. Faecal calprotectin (fÂ­Cp) and S100A12 (fÂ­SA12) are non-invasive stool markers for inflammation in the gut and can be used to distinguish between functional and inflammatory bowel disease(IBD). Serum calprotectin is potentially elevated in pregnancy and currently the usefullness of fÂ­CP is unknown in pregnant women with inflammatory bowel disease. This is a pilot study to take sequential stool and blood samples from pregnant women both with and without inflammatory bowel disease and assess whether there is any value of serum and fÂ­CP and S100A12 as surrogate markers for inflammation in pregnancy.","Healthy pregnant women, IBD pregnant women, IBD nonÂ­pregnant women, RA nonÂ­pregnant women, RA pregnant women."

The form of EPO we use in Addenbrookes is Darbepoetin (AranespÂ®). EPO is safe to use but it has been associated with a rise in blood pressure (BP) in some individuals. The reasons for this are not clear. To try to explain this we want to study how EPO affects certain substances in the blood that influence how blood vessels contract and relax. We will conduct this by infusing small amounts of Acetylcholine, BQ123 and Noradrenaline into the arm vessels of volunteers using an established method called Forearm blood flow (plethysmography). Volunteers recruited for this study will include CKD patients undergoing therapy with Darbepoetin as part of their normal NHS care as well as healthy people not on treatment, who will act as controls.

13,Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue,Disorders of bone density and structure,Research on Efficacy of Teriparatide use in the Return of recruits to Normal duty.,"Lower limb stress fractures require long periods of rehabilitation and are increasingly common during Infantry training. Strategies to improve stress fracture rehabilitation and expedite return to full duties are therefore being sought by the military in order to reduce medical attrition rates. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is made naturally in the body and helps to repair bone damage. Additional PTH is often given to women with osteoporosis (a condition that weakens bones, making them more likely to break) to reduce the risk of further fractures. However, there is very limited research on the effect of PTH on a healthy population who have experienced an acute fracture because of exercise. We want to know if PTH can reduce pain and the time spent in rehabilitation by recruiting 136 military cadets who have been diagnosed with a lower limb stress fracture via MRI scan. After completing initial assessments and safety blood tests, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either PTH or treatment as usual in a 1:1 ratio. Participants randomised to the intervention arm will receive PTH administered via sub-cutaneous injection and will be required to inject themselves every day, at the same time of day, for a minimum of 16-weeks. If the patient has not reached radiological healing at this stage treatment will continue to 24-weeks.

4,"Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases",Metabolic disorders,Investigating outcomes in adults with early-treated phenylketonuria (PKU),"Worldwide, there are many adults with phenylketonuria (PKU) who have phenylalanine (Phe) levels significantly above 600 Âµmol/L. Although the majority of these patients feel well and are leading normal lives, for many years there have been reports of subtle neuropsychological defects in these patients, and case reports of some patients developing psychiatric or neurological disease. As a result, in the USA it is recommended that all individuals with PKU maintain Phe levels of < 360 Âµmol/L throughout life. This year, European guidelines were published which will set a target of < 600 Âµmol/L for adults with PKU. However, there is currently no good evidence to support these recommendations for all adults with PKU. We hypothesize that, in individuals with previous good metabolic control in childhood and adolescence, Phe levels in adulthood have minimal / no impact on anxiety, depression, quality of life and social and occupational functioning. We aim to assess long-term outcomes in PKU, with a series of detailed questionnaires and outpatient-based neurocognitive tests administered to patients with PKU and to a matched control group. By looking at the educational and social achievements of adolescent and adult patients, treated from the neonatal period, and assessing perceived quality of life, mood and occupational functioning we would like to identify whether these individuals have reproducible problems and, if so, whether they are related to their Phe levels, either current or historical. 372 patients are currently under active review at the Charles Dent Metabolic Unit. We intend to invite all those meeting inclusion criteria to participate, making this one of the largest adult outcome studies in PKU to date.

22,Codes for special purposes,Provisional assignment of new diseases of uncertain etiology,A clinical trial of nebulized surfactant for the Treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19 in adults,"Lung surfactant is present in the lungs. It covers the alveolar surface where it reduces the work of breathing and prevents the lungs from collapsing. In some respiratory diseases and in patients that require ventilation this substance does not function normally. The hypothesis behind this research is that a deficiency of functionally intact surfactant contributes to the deterioration in pulmonary function in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. We would like to find out whether administering doses of surfactant corrects this deficiency and leads to an improvement in lung function in patients with COVID-19. We would like to conduct an initial feasibility study to assess what dosing schedule produces the best response in patientâs that receive this treatment. To do this, patients will be randomised at a 3:2 ratio to receive treatment with the study drug or act as a control. Patients in the treatment arm will be allocated sequentially into one of four dosing groups with escalating dosing schedules. Patients in the control arm will not receive surfactant therapy. Bovactant (AlveofactÂ®) is the selected surfactant for this study. It will be adminstered via a modified nebuliser at Day 0 and again at 8 hours and 24 hours post first dose. The nebuliser is modified to generate particles of sufficiently small diameter which provides the potential to deliver significantly larger surfactant volumes for effective delivery to the lungs. The improvement in oxygenation and pulmonary ventilation will be measured. Safety data will be reviewed throughout the patient's hospitalisation.

PsA is a seronegative spondyloarthropathy (SpA), a class of inflammatory arthritis including ankylosing spondylitis, reactive and inflammatory bowel disease related arthritis. Joint damage, a serious outcome of PsA, occurring in 40% of patients, is not possible to predict. Immune cells, including T-cells, and their pro-inflammatory products (cytokines),eg interleukin-17, may play a role in joint damage. The aims of this study are: (1) characterise the contribution of IL-17 producing immune cells to the pathogenesis of PsA. (2) Investigate if levels of specific immune cells or joint ultrasound can be used to predict which patients will develop joint damage. And, (3) identify common inflammatory pathways in skin and joints in participants with psoriasis and PsA and compare these with other forms of arthritis including rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthropathies and osteoarthritis. We will recruit adults with arthritis and psoriasis attending rheumatology outpatient clinics at Guys and St Thomas', Kings College and Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trusts, and Frimley Park Hospital. We will collect blood, joint (synovial) fluid and, sometimes, small samples of joint tissue(synovial tissue) and skin. As controls we will collect blood from healthy volunteers.

10,Diseases of the respiratory system,Chronic lower respiratory diseases,Acquisition of physiological signals with a wearable technology to assist on research aiming to improve early identification of exacerbations in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD),"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a respiratory condition which affects approximately 3 million people in the UK and 210 million in the world. The disease is characterized by progressive air flow obstruction and decline of lung function. The resulting narrowing of the airways makes it harder to breathe in and out. COPD is currently the fourth leading cause of death in the world. The main reason for hospitalisations associated with COPD is exacerbations (chest infections or a worsening of the underlying symptoms). Severe COPD exacerbations are the second largest cause of emergency admissions in the UK. Mild and moderate exacerbations can be managed outside the hospital but if they are not identified promptly they may progress to breathlessness and in some patients to respiratory failure. Thus, finding modalities for early detection and diagnosis of exacerbations is clearly a priority for current and future COPD research. But these still do not exist. The aim of this study will be to acquire acoustic respiratory signals from COPD patients with a very small wearable device. These signals will be subsequently used to carry out engineering research with the objective of trying to find ""fingerprints"" in them which could be early indicators of disease exacerbations. If those ""fingerprints"" were found, subsequent research could focus on trying to create software methods which, together with the use of a small wearable device, would aim at automatically detecting exacerbations when they are at very early stages- prior to the symptoms being evident to the patient- so that clinical intervention could be triggered, in order to optimize the disease outcomes.",Patients with a diagnosis of COPD (FEV1:FVC < 0.7).
19,"Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes","Complications of surgical and medical care, not elsewhere classified",A prospective non interventional study to evaluate the role of immune and inflammatory response in recipients of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) affected by severe COVID19 infection,"SARS-COv19 is a novel virus within the Coronavirus family which is responsible of a pandemia which has become a sanitary emergency. As of March 24th 2020 according to the world health organization, 190 countries worldwide have reported COVID19 cases, with a total number of 334,981 positive patients and 14,652 confirmed death from COVID19. While this virus seems to cause mild flu like symptoms in most of the affected individuals, around 15% of them will require hospital admission and up to 10 % might require intensive care treatment. Preliminary data (Jing et al, MedRxiv 2020; Mehta P, The Lancet 2020) seem to suggest that a proportion of the severely affected patients becomes ill mostly due to the severity of the inflammatory/immune response their body produces to try and attack the virus. In selected cases, this finding has allowed to administer specific and very potent anti inflammatory drugs, which have helped improving the clinical situation (example Tocilizumab). In the UK around 1800 adults and children receive allogeneic stem cell transplantation every year because of life threatening conditions. Usually stem cell transplanted individuals are at high risk of developing severe disease when exposed to viral infections. Extremely little data are available internationally so far about stem cell transplanted recipients who have been affected by COVID19 ( 15 cases reported throughout Europe as of the 20th March 2020 and 1 case in the Uk reported on the 23 March 2020).

9,Diseases of the circulatory system,Other and unspecified disorders of the circulatory system,The Gut-Liver Axis in liver disease and liver transplantation,"Patients with both acute and chronic liver failure are at risk of sepsis and multiple organ failure. Similarly patients with sepsis are at risk of development of liver dysfunction with escape of endotoxin produced by bacteria that reside in their intestines, which becomes 'leakier'. Gut dysfunction is defined by changes in the types of bacteria within the gut and in overall 'leakiness' allowing bacterial products which would otherwise be contained within the gut to travel into the bloodstream and lymphatic system and have detrimental effects elsewhere in the body. This passage of bacterial products is defined as bacterial translocation, and their effects on the liverÂ­related and general immune system can be then be measured. This study aims to investigate the role of gut dysfunction and its impact on bacterial translocation and immune system dysfunction in individuals with a range of acute and chronic liver failure syndromes and sepsis, as well as those undergoing operative procedures such as liver transplantation, liver resection and placement on cardiopulmonary bypass at time of cardiac surgery. This may allow in the future for therapeutic strategies which may improve outcome, particularly intervening within the gut to prevent bacterial translocation. There is evidence emerging to suggest that the leakiness of the gut is affected by gut microbe activity. These trillions of organisms within the gut lumen are very diverse, affected by multiple factors including liver disease, and help control chemical reactions related to digestion and absorption of nutrients. The chemical byproducts of these reactions often appear in the urine or blood where they can be detected by techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This powerful window on metabolism allows us to clearly see which chemical pathways are abnormal in the patients we are studying, providing biomarkers for diagnosis and potential sites for intervention and treatment.","LIVER FAILURE GROUP â¢ AoCLF: Patients with chronic liver disease (cirrhosis) that suffer an acute decompensation in their liver function following an acute insult (e.g. infection) resulting in organ dysfunction.

11,Diseases of the digestive system,Other diseases of the digestive system,"Patients with Peristomal Contour Abnormalities: their thoughts about surgery, leakages and quality of life","Background: An uneven skin surface around a stoma can result in management problems such as leakage of stool onto the skin, skin excoriation, soiling of clothing, poor quality of life, frequent visits to stoma care nurses, and excessive usage of pouches and accessories. Current treatment interventions make the process of changing a pouch a complicated, time-consuming and costly experience. Reconstructive surgeons at Western Sussex Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust have been using lipomodelling or âfat transferâ in breast cancer patients with great success. During the last year they introduced this technique to stoma patients and especially to those who have a permanent stoma and suffer from leakages due to abnormalities around the stoma. The aim is to refashion the stoma with a minimally invasive approach, reshaping the surface of the abdomen using fat transfer instead of performing a laparotomy and moving the stoma. The procedure was performed on a small group of patients (N=6) who reported a decrease in the number of leakages, a decrease in the need to change clothes due to a leakage, and an increase in their stoma-related quality of life. Despite these preliminary results it is not known whether patients are willing to undergo surgery in order to minimize leakages. Aims: To interview patients and explore their views regarding the feasibility and acceptability of this surgical intervention to manage peristomal leakages. First we plan to interview the patients who have already had the lipomodelling procedure and ask their views. We want to hear from the patients themselves about the ways in which their quality life has improved after the procedure. Do the risks outweigh the benefits? Was it worth going through the process?

2,Neoplasms,Benign neoplasms,"Validation of a virtual clinic for choroidal nevomelanocytic lesions: safety, patient acceptability and health economics analysis","Choroidal nevomelanocytic lesion is the medical term to describe a lesion similar to a freckle or mole at the back of the eye. Such lesions are fairly common, present in up to 7% of the general population. They usually remain undetected for life and in the vast majority of cases are no cause for concern. Such lesions are increasingly being picked up during routine check-ups at community optometry practices. These freckles or moles at the back of the eye carry an extremely small chance of growing and changing into something more sinister like a melanoma. Because of this minimal risk, optometrists refer almost without exception these patients to hospital eye units for an expert opinion. Patients are seen routinely in outpatient clinics and frequently require a further attendance for additional tests such as an ultrasound. Understandably, patients undergo a period of significant anxiety, often referred by their opticians 'to exclude malignancy'. No general agreement exists, however, on how these referrals should be managed in a safe and efficient manner. This research project aims at showing that a one-stop, dedicated clinic for referrals of these lesions relying on the expertise of allied health professionals such as nurses, optometrists or imaging technicians can be safe and offer a pleasant experience of care. Patients will receive an information letter explaining their condition and their expected journey through our service. During their visit they will have a series of tests done by an expert technician with immediate feedback and re-assurance. We will produce evidence to support the role of non-medical professionals offering care for these common lesions. Eventually, our research may allow safely managing these lesions in community-based optometrist practices, bringing care closer to home.","Patients under the care of MREH and MEH for ocular nevomelanocytic lesions (CNL) will be recruited prospectively into the study. They will be provided with a patient information leaflet sent by post prior to their planned visit to the clinic. All patients attending the CNL clinics of MREH/MEH who have offered informed consent will be included in the study. Patients who are then diagnosed with alternate pathologies other than CNL (erroneous referrals) will be excluded from agreement analysis.

The use of TDF for the treatment of hepatitis B/HIV has been associated with reductions in kidney function. Tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF) is a medication that is converted to active tenofovir in the blood and is associated with at least equal effectivness against both HIV and hepatitis B infections but with the advantage of less adverse effects on kidney function and bone mineral density.It has been shown to be effective in treating HIV infected and HBV infected indivuduals but there are fewer data on its use in individuals infected with both HIV and HBV.

6,Diseases of the nervous system,Extrapyramidal and movement disorders,Quantitative MRI for Anatomical Phenotyping in Parkinsonâs disease (qMAP-PD),"Parkinsonâs disease is a common degenerative disorder of the brain that becomes more likely with age. A combination of muscle stiffness, tremor and slow movements alert the clinician to its presence. These symptoms begin to be detectable once half of the nerve cells within a brain region called the substantia nigra have already died. Once diagnosed, disease progression is highly variable. About half the people diagnosed will develop significant problems within four years. There is evidence that Parkinsonâs disease actually begins up to 20 years before it is diagnosed; it starts in a different part of the brain and progresses slowly causing more subtle problems. This intervening period is called âpre-clinical Parkinsonâsâ. During this period there are certain problems, such as loss of smell or certain sleep disturbances, which are more likely to be experienced by individuals with the condition. However, it is not currently possible to identify who amongst these individuals have pre-clinical Parkinsonâs or how quickly the disease will progress once diagnosed. This work seeks to use non-invasive brain-scanning techniques to understand why Parkinsonâs disease is so variable, develop ways to predict how quickly the disease will progress based on an individualâs brain structure and diagnose the condition during the pre-clinical phase. We will pair this information with genetic and other blood markers, to try to understand some of the biological reasons causing this variability. By achieving these aims, strategies aimed at slowing the condition can be researched more accurately, and the disease can be better characterized within an individual, allowing current treatments to be tailored to their present and future needs.","â¢ HEALTHY CONTROL SUBJECTS: Gender and age matched age (Â±5 years) for PD cohort â¢ PD SUBJECTS: Diagnosis of PD based on UK Brain Bank Criteria made within the preceding two years. â¢ HIGH RISK PRE-CLINICAL PD = REM SLEEP BEHAVIOURAL DISORDER (RBD) SUBJECTS: Fulfils the International Classification of Sleep Disorders for RBD â¢ Age > = 18 years, < = 80 years â¢ Subjects are able to provide informed consent. â¢ Subjects consent to 3D intraoral scanner to create a mini-mouthguard â¢ The subjects consent to the use prospective motion correction during MRI by wearing the mini-mouthguard."
9,Diseases of the circulatory system,Ischaemic heart diseases,CXCR2 inhibition: a novel approach to treating coronary heart disease,"Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease of blood vessels, which gives rise to fatty deposits ('atheromatous plaques') and narrowing of those vessels. It is the commonest cause of death and disability in the Western world, and its thrombotic complications - predominantly myocardial infarction ('heart attack') and stroke - are initiated by plaque erosion and rupture, a process in which white blood cells (in particular neutrophils) play a prominent role. In this study, we will determine whether inhibition of neutrophil migration into plaques, using the novel drug AZD5069 (which inhibits a molecule called CXCR2, which is central to normal neutrophil function), will improve the structure and function of coronary arteries in patients with coronary heart disease who are undergoing interventional treatment for atherosclerosis in their coronary arteries involving balloon dilatation of narrowed areas together with placement of a stent (so-called percutaneous coronary intervention, or PCI). We will randomise patients with coronary heart disease undergoing PCI to receive either AZD5069 or placebo, on top of usual therapy, for a period of 6 months. The primary outcome measure will be the effect of CXCR2 inhibition on coronary vascular function, as measured by coronary flow reserve (a measure of the coronary arteries to dilate, assessed by PET scanning, and in a subset with invasive coronary flow measurements). Secondary outcome measures will be plaque re-narrowing ('restenosis', assessed by intravascular ultrasound or IVUS) and internal structure (again by IVUS), as well as change in small blood vessel function (measured using a special wire in the coronary arteries called a ComboWire). These measures will indicate whether CXCR2 inhibition is likely to lead to an improvement in outcome in such patients in the longer term.","â¢ Men and women â¥ 18 years of age. â¢ Angiographically proven coronary heart disease undergoing native-vessel PCI for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction or unstable or stable coronary disease. â¢ Absolute blood neutrophil count at the time of PCI as well as 4 weeks after PCI of >4.0 x 109/L. â¢ Otherwise receiving standard of care for ischaemic heart disease (including appropriate anti-platelet therapy, statin, antihypertensive as clinically indicated). â¢ Women of childbearing potential may be included in the study provided they are established on, and continue to use highly effective contraceptive methods (as defined in Protocol section 6.2.1) from the time of screening until 1 week after the final dose of study drug.

This is a retrospective (hypothesis generating) / prospective,multicentre, non-interventional observational trial performed in 2 stages for patients with first ovarian cancer relapse with a Platinum Free interval > = 6 months. The study has the aim to improve the clinical management of first platinum sensitive ovarian cancer relapse by improving the AGO Score for resectability which is a useful predictor for operability in patients with ovarian cancer by adding HE4 serum concentrations and CA125 level which will be used to develop a new algorithm (HELP-ER Score). In the first step (part A) an algorithm will be developed on a retrospective cohort of about 188 patients from Tumour Bank Ovarian Cancer (TOC) - network (6 sites from 4 different countries).

6,Diseases of the nervous system,Demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system,A novel online program for fatigue; a feasibility study,"Research has shown that Long Term Conditions (LTCâs) are associated with high levels of fatigue, depression, anxiety, distress and disability. Unhelpful or negative thinking styles may play a role in the perpetuation and maintenance of symptoms of fatigue and distress. This study aims to develop more positive, adaptive thinking styles using an online training program. Prior to this study, suitable materials will be developed and the program tested using qualitative methods and think aloud techniques. The feasibility study of the online program will start with individuals with Chronic Fatigue (CF) including both patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS)/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) and idiopathic chronic fatigue (ICF). We will use qualitative and quantitative methods to explore the acceptability, feasibility and effectiveness of the program. We will make revisions to the program based on the outcomes and feedback from this phase. We will also recruit other populations of people with long term physical health conditions, who experience high levels of fatigue (e.g. cancer and multiple sclerosis). Participants will complete 12 sessions of the computerised training programme (4 sessions per week, over 3 weeks) with each session lasting approximately 20 minutes. All sessions will be completed at home, online on a computer or tablet. Questionnaire based assessments will be completed before and after the 12 training sessions and at 1-month and 3-month follow-ups.","All Participants must: - Meet caseness for fatigue (i.e. a score of 4 or more on the Chlader Fatigue Scale, 1993) - Be aged 18 years or older - Be fluent in English - Have normal or corrected -to-normal vision, hearing, manual dexterity - Not be currently undergoing psychological treatment - Have access to a computer or tablet with an internet connection In addition: Participants must either: - Have a diagnosis of chronic fatigue o including a diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) or idiopathic chronic fatigue (ICF) Or: o have one or more long-term physical health condition defined as a condition that cannot, at present be cured; but can be controlled by medication and other therapies; and requires ongoing management over a period of years or decades."
13,Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue,Inflammatory polyarthropathies,"Does the Corin Optimised Positioning System improve clinical outcome in total hip arthroplasty? A multi-centre, two-arm randomised control trial","We aim to investigate whether the use of the Corin Optimised Positioning System (OPS) for implant positioning during total hip replacement (THR) is superior to current implant positioning practice during THR by way of a randomised controlled trial comparing the two. At present, the dislocation rate after THR reported in Joint Registries is between 1 and 3%, with studies reporting a dislocation rate as high as 15%. A recent study showed that 58% of patients who had suffered dislocation after THR had implants judged to be in a safe position. This has led to suggestions that the previous idea of one generic 'safe zone' may be misleading, and instead there is a unique optimum position to place the prosthetic cup in each patient undergoing THR, based on the unique interaction of their spine and pelvis. The Corin OPS is a new technique designed to enable delivery of the prosthetic cup into the optimum position for each patient. Dynamic preoperative imaging allows creation of a model, which facilitates accurate placement of the cup. We will perform a randomised controlled trial of 460 patients. 230 will receive THR will conventional positioning; the other 230 will receive THR with Corin OPS to guide positioning. Patients will be aged 18-85 years, listed for THR at a participating site. Primary outcome will be dislocation rate at 1 year. We predict recruitment will take 2 years.

21,Factors influencing health status and contact with health services,Persons with potential health hazards related to socioeconomic and psychosocial circumstances,"A mixed-method impact, economic and process evaluation of how a peer advocacy intervention for people experiencing homelessness in London facilitates access to health care and enables well-being.","People experiencing homelessness suffer extreme health inequalities. The average age of death is 47 years for homeless people and even lower for women (43 years), they are between 5-7 times more likely to die prematurely than the general population. Homeless people are more vulnerable to tuberculosis, hepatitis C and HIV, injury and chronic physical and poor mental health that result from limited access to health care and harsh living conditions. Access to health services is hindered by organisational challenges, fear of stigma and difficulties reconciling daily demands of being homeless with prioritising care. As a result, presentation at health care is delayed until it is urgent and use of accident and emergency services and hospitals is high; this represents potentially avoidable ill-health and distress, but also significant health system costs. The health care costs of homeless people are estimated to be 8 times higher than the general population. Groundswell, a third sector organisation, have pioneered Homeless Health Peer Advocacy (HHPA) among homeless populations in London, a model that is being adapted by others. Peer advocates who themselves have experience of homelessness provide one-to-one support to attend health care appointments. The availability of a trusted advocate, with similar experience, to guide health care encounters; overcome logistical, structural and psychosocial challenges; and enhance individual and community understanding could be an acceptable, effective and cost-efficient intervention. There is limited evidence showing the impact of peer advocates on health service utilisation and other health and social outcomes, nor the mechanisms through which the intervention works. Further evidence would facilitate development and scale-up of the intervention among homeless and other vulnerable populations in London and elsewhere. This research led by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine with Kings College, UCL and in collaboration with Groundswell will evaluate how and to what extent the intervention changes the way homeless populations use outpatient and emergency services and how it shapes other health and social outcomes (e.g. mental health, drug use and access to drug and alcohol or mental health services). Qualitative research methods (interviews and observation) will also be used to understand how peer advocacy works and on what health and social outcomes. We will compare how engagement with peer advocates affects homeless peoplesâ use of health services and their health through a survey of 600 people who are currently homeless, some who work with peer advocates and some who do not and linking individuals to routinely recorded electronic health records. We will look at how much the intervention costs, and is cost saving, compared to no intervention in relation to increasing planned use of health services and decreasing use of emergency services and hospital care. The research team has extensive multi-disciplinary experience of research with homeless and excluded populations. We will involve peers and the homeless in the study both as researchers and on the advisory group. The study will be overseen by an advisory group consisting of people with experience of homelessness, agencies providing specialist services for homeless populations, policy makers and researchers. Findings will be disseminated at workshops for: 1) community groups for people currently or previously homeless; 2) policy makers and service providers; and 3) agencies employing peer advocates to integrate findings into existing interventions.","We will include people who are homeless who both have and have not engaged with peer advocacy (we will draw on the Department of Healthâs definition of homelessness comprising: people sleeping rough, people sleeping in a hostel, and people in insecure or short-term accommodation, such as in a squat or on a friendâs floor, who cycle into rough sleeping and the hostel system). All participants will be aged over 25 We will include Groundswell peer advocates (all aged over 18), both those in training, those currently working, and those who have left Groundswell after going on to other employment or opportunities. We will include Groundswell staff, including those who are currently employed by Groundswell and involved in supporting or managing the HHPA programme. We will include stakeholders who are working in service delivery, support or policy in relation to homelessness in London."
10,Diseases of the respiratory system,Chronic lower respiratory diseases,Investigation of the influence of the Maternal Environment in Pregnancy (MEP) on the unborn child and the development of lung disease such as asthma in early life.,"Does illness of the mother during pregnancy such as allergic asthma have an effect on the unborn child to develop asthma in early life? Background: In the UK, asthma is found in 1 in 11 children and often from allergic/asthmatic mothers, suggesting that disease is inherited through the genes from our parents. One of these asthma genes, ADAM33, makes an enzyme that is normally attached to cells in the airway muscle. In people with asthma the ADAM33 enzyme loses its anchor to the cell surface and is released into the lung. We know from our animal studies that if mothers suffer from allergic airway inflammation the released form of ADAM33 protein is increased in the amniotic fluid, which surrounds the babies and fills their lungs in the womb. We do not know if this is also the case in human asthma. The aim of this basic science study is to better understand how illnesses such as allergic asthma during pregnancy induce factors such as ADAM33 in the womb that have an effect on the development of asthma. We will collect different body fluids and tissues before, during and after a routinely planed operation (Caesarean section) in which the baby is delivered out of the womb at the University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust. These research samples are blood, urine, amniotic fluid, tissue from umbilical cord and placenta (tube and vascular organ that connect baby with mother in the womb) that provide oxygen and nutrients to the baby. These samples are normally thrown away. We will compare samples from healthy mothers and mothers with allergy/asthma or other illnesses during pregnancy. By studying factors such as ADAM33 we will better understand how these factors might influence the development of lung disease and how we could possibly prevent asthma in early life.",1. gestation beyond 37.0 weeks 2. planned elective caesarian birth 3. able and willing to give informed consent
14,Diseases of the genitourinary system,Renal failure,Using Patient-Reported Outcome measures (PROMs) to promote quality of care and safety in the management of patients with Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease. (PRO-trACK Project),"Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with symptoms that can significantly reduce patientsâ health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The symptoms/HRQOL of patients can be captured using self-reported questionnaires, known as patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Rationale Emerging evidence suggest that the use of electronic PROMs (ePROM) in routine clinical setting may improve outcomes at an individual patient level by enhancing the detection and monitoring of symptoms (Basch et al 2011). The use of ePROMs can also facilitate the tailoring of treatment to the individual needs of patients(Greenhalgh 2009, Hjollund 2014). The WestChronic System has been successfully implemented in Denmark for tailoring the care of various patient groups(Hjollund 2014). In the UK, the Advanced Symptom Management System (ASyMS)was successfully used to monitor the side effects of chemotherapy (McCann 2009). The aim of the PRO-trACK project is to explore the feasibility of using an ePROM system for symptom monitoring and individual management of adult patients with advanced CKD. Methods Following a systematic review and PPI facilitated PROM selection and topic guide development we will conduct: Study 1 - Usability testing Usability testing of the ePROM system with patients with CKD Study 2 â Qualitative Study (1) Qualitative interviews with patients with CKD and (2)focus groups/interviews with clinical staff from the UHB renal service, members of the myHealth team and hospital management or informatics team if required, to explore their views on the use and administration of the CKD ePROM system.

Furthermore, we aim to determine whether the accumulation of these metabolites differs spatially throughout the different anatomical zones of the prostate, alters gene expression, and are detectable globally in blood and urine. We seek approval to undertake a double-blinded, randomised, factorial design study, in which patients will be randomised into one of four arms and required to consume 4 capsules once daily for a period of > = 4 weeks, made up of a combination of 2 of the following: Alliin/SACSO (derived from garlic), Sulforaphane (derived from broccoli), or placebo.

9,Diseases of the circulatory system,Ischaemic heart diseases,Diagnostic accuracy of cardiovascular magnetic resonance versus computed tomography with fractional flow reserve in suspected coronary artery disease,"Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death and disability in the UK. Restricted blood flow to the heart causes chest pain or sometimes a heart attack. Good treatments are available but we first need to identify who has a problem. We can use an invasive test called a âcoronary angiogramâ: to identify any blood vessel narrowings or blockages. However, the test can be painful, and there is a risk of things going wrong. Therefore, guidelines recommend using scans first, as they are safer and less unpleasant. It remains uncertain which is the most accurate type of scan. National guidelines currently recommend a specific scan called âcomputed tomography coronary angiographyâ, or CTCA. This helps to rule out disease in some patients who donât have a problem. However, about half the patients who donât have a problem will also seem to have something wrong according to this scan. This can be very worrying for patients, especially as they may then need a âcoronary angiogramâ test to check if they really do have a narrowing . Computed tomography fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) is an exciting new test which uses a supercomputer to analyse the CTCA scan pictures. A few studies involving carefully selected patients show that this is more accurate than using a CTCA scan alone. However, before we start using it more widely (which means the NHS needs many more scanners), we need to compare it with other types of scans. Currently, the best performing is a heart magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. A bonus with MRI is that it doesnât use radiation, and recent innovations may make it even more accurate. Our study will determine which approach is more accurate, benefitting patients and the NHS by helping avoid unnecessary unpleasant tests which require hospital admission.","Patients aged > = 18years Referred for invasive coronary angiography for investigation of chest pain Willing and able to give informed consent Willing and able (in the Investigators opinion) to comply with all study requirements.

2,Neoplasms,Malignant neoplasms of digestive organs,,"Background: An adverse event (AE) is any unfavourable sign, symptom or disease, temporarily associated with the use of a treatment, but that may or may not be considered related to the treatment. The current system for reporting AEs, the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) relies on the clinicianâs interpreting patient symptoms. The value of patient self-reports of AEs and other Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) has been recognised by clinicians, regulatory authorities and health-care commissioners. Once eRAPID is developed, it will allow patients to: electronically report AEs through an online questionnaire; get advice on how to manage mild symptoms and when to seek medical advice; and an alert will be sent straightaway to a patients doctor or specialist nurse when patients report serious adverse events (SAE). The proposed work described in this form relates to the sub-study in Bristol to undertake the usability testing of the eRAPID system following surgery for UGI cancer. Objectives: The aim of this project is to test the usability of the eRAPID system with patients and surgical oncology staff after patients are discharged from hospital following their surgery. Study Sample: The participant sample will comprise two groups: patients who are undergoing surgery for UGI cancer (N=30-40) and health professional staff involved in their care (N=5). Study measures: Patients will be asked to complete symptom questionnaire 2-3 days after discharge, 5-7 after discharge and then weekly up until 8 weeks has passed since they were discharged. Patient-reported outcome questionnaires (EQ-5D) will also be posted or given to patients at 4 and 8 weeks post discharge. Health professional staff involved in the care of patients will be asked to monitor electronic reports generated by patient completion of the questionnaire via the eRAPID system and be asked to provide feedback on the study.","Patients: 1) Have a diagnosis of UGI cancer? 2) Have completed surgery for UGI cancer (e.g. oesophagectomy, Whipples procedure, hemi or partial hepatectomy, gastrectomy, distal pancreatectomy)? 3) Are ready (or nearly ready) for hospital discharge? 4) Have English as a first language? 5) Are able to comply with the follow-up procedure? 6) Have access to a computer/tablet and internet access to access the system from home (with/without help from a relative/carer/friend). 7) Aged 18 years or older Staff: Staff involved in the post-operative care of UGI cancer patients"
5,Certain infectious and parasitic diseases,Other bacterial diseases,Antibiotic Reduction and Conservation in Hospitals (ARK-Hospital),"Antibiotics kill bacteria, but donât cure viral infections. When sick patients arrive at hospital, doctors have to work out whether they have a bacterial infection, viral infection, or another illness. This is difficult, because initial symptoms can be very similar (e.g. cough, temperature). Finding out exactly why a patient is sick takes a while, so it makes sense to give antibiotics initially. However, Department of Health guidance recommends stopping antibiotics when it becomes clear that they arenât needed anymore. This could be because doctors work out that the patient never had a bacterial infection, or because they have got better. Stopping antibiotics when they arenât needed reduces the chances of disease-causing and other gut bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics. It is also important because antibiotics kill âfriendlyâ gut bacteria. But stopping antibiotics when they are no longer needed often doesnât happen. Sometimes this is âjust in caseâ or thinking âbetter safe than sorryâ, or because of the myth that antibiotic courses must be completed to avoid resistance. This research will test whether a package of strategies can help doctors, nurses, pharmacists and patients stop antibiotics in hospital when they are no longer needed. The package includes internet-based training, standard systems to review patients, regular support from pharmacists/infection specialists, and materials for patients. First, we will test the package in one hospital to make sure that it is practical (âfeasibility studyâ). We will then implement the package in 1-3 more hospitals, testing how many people use it and improving the package (âinternal pilotâ). If we meet specific criteria, we will implement the package in 36 hospitals in total (âmain trialâ). We will compare mortality and antibiotic use in patients admitted to general medicine before and after its introduction using data from electronic hospital records from admission to 90 days later.","For NHS Trusts to participate in phase I, II or III of the evaluation, the only inclusion criteria are â¢ Acute or district general NHS Trust admitting patients to acute/general medicine â¢ Willing to implement the intervention in healthcare professionals involved in antibiotic prescribing or administration in adult acute/general medicine, and able to identify a local âchampionâ to lead this â¢ Able to provide the required routine electronic data on adult patients admitted to acute/general medicine over the required time periods For patients and relatives/carers providing anonymous acceptability questionnaires and invited to take part in the interview studies, the only inclusion criteria are â¢ Admitted to acute/general medicine either themselves, or a close friend or family member who supported the patient during their inpatient stay and antibiotic treatment â¢ Received a course of antibiotic treatment started in hospital in the last 7-14 days â¢ Willing to be complete an anonymous questionnaire OR willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the interview study (respectively) â¢ Male or female, aged 18 years or above For local champions invited to take part in interview studies and healthcare workers invited to take part in focus groups, the only inclusion criteria are being willing to be interviewed or attend a focus group respectively."
5,Mental and behavioural disorders,Unspecified mental disorder,"A qualitative enquiry into the urban nature experiences of mental health service users, seeking to understand if and how contact with urban nature improves subjective wellbeing and mental health for people with severe and enduring mental health difficulties.","Why? The aim of our study is to explore if and how contact with urban nature improves wellbeing for people with complex mental health difficulties. Many studies from different disciplines cite benefits of nature for wellbeing, but most have been carried out with general populations, often excluding people with complex mental health difficulties. We hope that our findings will inform urban design and patient care via a range of decision makers: public health policy makers; city planners; landscape designers; clinical commissioning groups; NHS health and social care trusts; mental health charities; nature and wildlife organisations. What? The study is based around using arts-methods to hear patientsâ past and present experiences of nature, especially urban nature. Who? Adults over 18 who are current clients of two of Sheffieldâs Social Care NHS Foundation Trust community mental health recovery services â one provides intensive rehabilitation and recovery teams, delivering packages of care to people in their own homes as alternative to hospital accommodation; another is a recovery service focussing on recovery, independence and social inclusion for people with complex mental health issues. Where? Participants will attend a non-clinical city centre community arts venue. Taster sessions will be offered both at the venue and at clinical locations. How? Arts-based workshops, successfully used with users of Sheffieldâs mental health support groups, will be offered to adult NHS mental health service users with complex mental health difficulties. An initial taster session will be offered followed by 6 weeks two-hour arts-based sessions, run by an experienced arts-facilitator and researcher. Sessions will provide activities (e.g. writing, art, collage, photography, mapping) which explore service usersâ experiences of and feelings about nature in the context of their wellbeing. Subject to participant wishes and consent, recovery workers may attend or support and the series of workshops will culminate in a celebratory exhibition.","Participants will be adults over the age of 18 who have enduring and/or complex mental health difficulties. They will, at the time of the study, be clients of Sheffield Health and Social Care NHS Foundation Trust Community mental health recovery services, receiving support in the community and/or their own homes from CERT or East Glade services in Sheffield."
9,Diseases of the circulatory system,Ischaemic heart diseases,Optimising Secondary PRevention and quality of life following EarlY Cardiac Rehabilitation: OSPREY-CR,"Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR) is a health care programme for people with heart disease. Although exercise training and decreasing inactivity remain the cornerstone of many CR programmes, effective rehabilitation involves other important things, such as helping with medication, improving diet and mental wellbeing and assisting with quitting smoking. The services provided by CR programmes can improve cardiovascular risk factor profiles, reduce cardiovascular disease progression and improve patients' health and wellbeing. However, suitable access to services and programme adherence is required, if patients are to benefit from a comprehensive CR programme. Aims 1) Explore the reasons underpinning patient adherence to, and attrition from early CR. 2) Explore which aspects of CR patients believe are important for improving health-related quality of life, and adhere to (or intend to adhere to) once they leave early CR. 3) Understand how current practice attempts to support patients' adherence to longer-term health behaviour change and CR core components. 4) Develop solutions to support patients with adherence to components of CR, facilitating the maintenance of behaviour change for long-term health and wellbeing. Objectives: 1a) Access CR service data (where available) to assess referral rates, uptake and adherence in six centres across the UK. 1b) Use questionnaires to explore why patients adhere to and dropout of the early stages of CR. This will take place at three time-points (baseline - when patients enrol on to early CR, 6 weeks - prior to discharge from early CR and six months - when the patient has left CR). 2) Explore patients' and professional's experiences of, and attitudes towards, the core components of CR (exercise training/ physical activity; medication adherence; dietary guidelines; stopping smoking) via semi-structured interviews. 3) Implement a two-day workshop, with patients, and health care professionals (HCPs) to collaboratively design user-centered interventions to improve long-term adherence to CR components.","- Can provide written informed consent. - Age > = 18 years. - No evidence of cognitive impairment which will limit the ability to follow basic instructions. - Patients who fall within the National Audit of Cardiac Rehabilitation priority groups (NACR).

2,Neoplasms,Malignant neoplasms of male genital organs,"POPS: A randomised phase II trial assessing PostÂ­Operative use of ProSpare, a rectal obturator in prostate cancer radiotherapy","Surgery to remove the prostate gland is one of the ways of treating prostate cancer. Some patients receive radiotherapy after surgery to the area where the prostate was removed from, known as the prostate bed, if the cancer may not have been completely removed. Radiotherapy to the prostate bed can cause side effects, which can cause bowel and bladder symptoms as well as reducing sexual function. To improve the accuracy in delivering the radiotherapy, a device called ProSpare, a singleÂ­use disposable device is inserted by the patient into the rectum daily at each radiotherapy treatment. The radiotherapy treatment takes around 15 minutes each day. This device has already been tested in patients having prostate radiotherapy and was well tolerated, with good treatment accuracy and a reduction in dose received by the rectum was calculated. Other ways to identify the treatment area have been tested, including the insertion of markers into the prostate bed, however, this procedure does have associated risks. The device will help us to identify where the treatment area is at each radiotherapy session. ProSpare can be âseenâ on the standard scans taken before a radiotherapy treatment and treatment position will be adjusted before each daily treatment using this information. Patients will be randomly selected to either have standard treatment or use ProSpare daily with adjusted setÂ­up margins, prior to this, patients will complete a quality of life questionnaire. During and after treatment, patients will be asked questions and given questionnaires to complete, asking about bowel, urinary and sexual function. We will look at the results in each group and see if treatment with ProSpare has a benefit in improving the side effects from radiotherapy. If a benefit is seen, then our aim would be for ProSpare guided radiotherapy to become part of the standard treatment for prostate bed radiotherapy.",Age > 18 years Patient has undergone radical prostatectomy Histologically confirmed prostatic cancer Patient due to receive postÂ­operative prostate bed radiotherapy either in the adjuvant or salvage setting WHO performance status 0Â­1 at randomisation Able to independently complete patient questionnaires Normal anal tone assessed on PR Written informed consent
10,Diseases of the respiratory system,Other acute lower respiratory infections,Avon Community Acquired Pneumonia Study (Avon CAP): A Pan-Pandemic Acute Lower Respiratory Tract Disease Surveillance Study,"Acute respiratory infection affects large numbers of people worldwide. Older people have higher disease incidence, suffering reduced quality of life and increased mortality. Previous studies defining the burden of adult respiratory infection are limited - they required either an identified cause (microbiological diagnosis) or Chest-Xray change (radiological diagnosis). This results in underestimates of adult disease because some cases arenât counted. In 2019, SARS-CoV-2 virus (coronavirus or COVID-19) emerged causing a worldwide pandemic. This is a new human pathogen, and there is no pre-existing immunity. We do not understand fully how this virus causes disease, nor the risk-factors for poor outcomes (including death). We also donât know how this virus interacts with other bacteria and viruses that cause human disease. This is important - if we can determine how these infections interact with each other and the consequences for affected individuals, we may be able to offer better vaccination strategies (disease prevention) and/or treatments. Other infections important in adult respiratory disease are pneumococcus and RSV (a cold virus). There are new vaccines available for adult use, but as we donât know the true disease burden of these infections, we cannot determine if using these vaccines in adults would be worthwhile. Participating hospitals will capture key data on all patients admitted with respiratory illness that are generated by clinical teams treating these patients (including demographics, co-morbidities, outcomes and results of investigations undertaken by medical teams). Patients will be invited to participate in the consented study involving additional testing for pneumococcal and RSV infection. This will identify more cases of these infections than routine testing. These data will help to accurately define the true amount of disease caused by respiratory illness, determine the subgroups of disease and the impact of COVID-19 on respiratory disease.","1.

6,Diseases of the nervous system,Episodic and paroxysmal disorders,Usage of bio-signals to detect epileptic seizures,"Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, affecting about 0.6% of the population worldwide and 750,000 people in the United Kingdom (Sander et al. 2003). About 1 in 3 of all people with epilepsy do not respond to any medication and continue to have uncontrolled seizures with consequent serious implications including a high risk of mortality (Forsgren et al. 2005). Early detection and treatment of seizures could potentially decrease the risk associated with epilepsy including mortality. Bio-signals obtained from non-EEG sensors may assume an important role in seizure detection. Increasing evidence has been produced by investigations analysing electrocardiogram, heart rate, movements, changes in skin temperature and sweating. Unobtrusive wearable sensors measuring these bio-signals are becoming increasingly available to the public. Data may be transmitted to the care team enabling a rapid recognition on a real-time basis raising the possibility of timely interventions that prevent further deterioration. However epilepsy is characterized by different type of seizures and an optimal combination of sensors might be required consider the patient-specific seizure type. We will monitor 48 consenting adult patients with epilepsy routinely referred to the Neurophysiology Departments at Kingâs College Hospital and Guyâs and St Thomasâ Hospitals for prolonged EEG recordings (telemetry, home-video telemetry (HVT)and polysomnography(PSG))using wearable bio-sensors. The sensors are designed for continuous acquisition of body temperature, cardiovascular parameters, movements, muscle activity and sweating. The focus of this study is to assess the performance of sensors in seizures detection (as compared with EEG), to establish the optimal combination according to seizure types and to evaluate the acceptability of their use. This project is integral part of RADAR-CNS which receives funding from the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking under grant agreement No 115902. This Joint Undertaking receives support from the European Unionâs Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme and EFPIA.",Eligibility criteria Inclusion criteria for patients: (i) diagnosis of epilepsy (ii) between the ages of 18 â 65 (the upper age limit was set to account for physiological changes in cardiovascular and autonomic parameters which are more prominent after the age of 65 and which may alter the study results).
13,Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue,Disorders of bone density and structure,The BLAST OFF (Bisphosphonate aLternAtive regimenS for the prevenTion of Osteoporotic Fragility Fractures) Study.,"Osteoporosis is a condition where bones become weak and fragile and can easily break. Suffering from one fragility fracture doubles your chance of having another. These fractures can affect a personâs life significantly and contribute to significant costs to the UK health service. Bisphosphonates are used to treat osteoporosis and help prevent fractures. The most commonly used bisphosphonate treatment is Alendronate, but taking it correctly is complicated and side-effects are common. Therefore only 1 in 4 people continue with Alendronate beyond 2 years. There are different forms of bisphosphonates that can be given in different ways and frequencies and may be more acceptable and tolerated by patients. The study will look at how effective different bisphosphonate regimens are compared to Alendronate at preventing fractures, whether the reduction in fracture risk can be achieved at reasonable financial cost and establish acceptability of different approaches to patients. The study will be completed in 3 stages. Stage 1A will update a systematic review to inform which regimens are most effective at reducing fractures and provide the best value for money. Stage 1B will consist of qualitative semi-structured interviews from a sample of stakeholders in receipt of or involved in the delivery of different bisphosphonate regimens, in order to identify which regimens are most acceptable to patients. Stage 2 will use focus groups and workshops to discuss uncertainties from Stage 1 and identify the most important outstanding questions for future research. This ethical review and information provided relates to Stage 1B. Stage 1A does not involve participants so does not require ethical review. Stage 2 will be conducted by the Royal Osteoporosis Society. Participants will not be invited via NHS organisations and no identifiable information will be collected. Use of the Health Research Authority decision tool identifies Stage 2 does not require ethical review.","Adults over the age of 18 with the ability to give informed consent. There is no maximum age range. Participants of all genders will be included.

9,Diseases of the circulatory system,"Diseases of arteries, arterioles and capillaries",Peri-Vascular adipose tissue inflammation Evaluated using coronary CT angiography,"The P-VECT study will determine the effectiveness of a new measurement technique looking at the inflammation in the coronary arteries supplying blood to the heart. Coronary CT angiograms (CCTAâs) are routine scans used to check for narrowing in the coronary arteries, which can lead to heart attacks. The new measurement uses the same scans to look outside the coronary arteries, at the surrounding fat tissue â it is called the Fat Attenuation Index (FAI). The fat is altered by the presence of inflammation in the arteries, and this can be picked up by the FAI method. Inflammation in the coronary arteries is thought to be a prime cause of sudden heart attack, even when there are no significant narrowings. P-VECT will involve scans of 200 patients with inflammation in their arteries, following them for 8 months while they either undergo routine treatment with statins and aspirin (which are known to reduce coronary artery inflammation), or will not receive treatment. The patients will be recruited from hospitals in Oxford, Leicester and London. By looking at the differences in FAI over time in these 2 groups, the researchers will gain valuable data on how sensitive this new measurement is to changes in coronary artery inflammation. The data will help design of further trials to assess the clinical effectiveness of FAI.","Male or Female, aged 30 to 80 years CCTA scan within previous 3 months showing mild coronary artery plaques (< 50% luminal stenosis) with a high FAI value (> 70.1 HU).

Clinical equipoise for statin and aspirin treatment, as determined by the local treating physician. In these patients, there is clinical equipoise because routine treatment with aspirin and statin is not mandated by current guidelines, but the presence of minor coronary artery plaques is frequently interpreted by clinicians as an indication for aspirin and statin treatment.

3,Diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs and certain disorders involving the immune mechanism,"Coagulation defects, purpura and other haemorrhagic conditions",Head-Us Scoring System: Assessment of the real-world impact of ultrasound on disease management and treatment decision-making in moderate and severe haemophilia,"Ultrasound represents a promising technique for the assessment of joint health in persons with heamophilia (PWH) by non-imaging specialists. The haemophilia Early Arthropathy Detection with Ultrasound (HEAD-US) programme has been developed with the aim of integrating joint ultrasound in the routine assessment of PWH through the use of a simplified scoring system. The inter-operator reliability of the technique among European haemophilia treaters has been validated and described elsewhere. This study aims to assess the real-world impact of ultrasound on disease management and treatment decision making in children (â¥6 years of age), adolescents and adults with haemophilia and to understand the true extent of ultrasound as a diagnostic tool compared with thorough physical examination. The study is designed as a cross-sectional, multicentre study to be carried out across Europe. 12-month retrospective data will be collected and patients will be assessed on clinical visits for up to 12 months from the start of the study (at 4, 8 and 12 months). Eligible participants for this study will be patients undergoing joint examination with ultrasound using the HEAD-US protocol as part of their routine clinical assessment. They will have a confirmed diagnosis of moderate (FVIII/FIX:C 1â 5%) or severe (FVIII/FIX:C-5%) haemophilia A or haemophilia B and be aged â¥6 years. They will be either on a prophylactic or an on-demand treatment regime. Joints with a previous history of surgery and joints with damage as a result of causes other than haemophilia-related bleeding will be excluded from the study.

18,"Symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified",General symptoms and signs,The STAR trial: Evaluation of a care pathway for patients with long-term pain after knee replacement,"Total knee replacement involves replacing the painful knee joint with an artificial joint. It is a major operation and people often experience some pain in the first three months after surgery. However, around one in five patients report moderate or severe pain after this initial recovery period. We call this âlong-termâ pain. We know that many people do not receive or seek care for long-term pain. Improving care and support for people with long-term pain after knee replacement will benefit patients, the NHS and society. Our proposed study will run a trial of a new, best care pathway to see if it is of benefit to patients with long-term pain after knee replacement. We will recruit 380 patients with pain at 3 months after knee replacement from four hospitals in the UK. Two-thirds of patients will be randomly chosen to receive the STAR care pathway and one-third of patients will receive the usual care that their hospital provides. The STAR pathway involves a clinic appointment with a healthcare professional to better understand the possible causes of pain after knee replacement. People will then be referred to see relevant health professionals for treatment as needed, such as physiotherapists, orthopaedic surgeons, GPs, or pain specialists. We may decide that for some people the most appropriate course of action is to regularly monitor their pain, and then begin treatment if the pain worsens. We will ask everyone in the study to complete questionnaires after 6 months and 12 months to see if the STAR care pathway improves patientsâ pain. We will also collect information to compare the cost of providing both treatments. The findings from this study will help us to know if providing the STAR care pathway can improve patientsâ outcomes after knee replacement and is good value for money to invest NHS resources.","Patients aged 18 years and over.

16,Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period,Other disorders originating in the perinatal period,Consecutive fetal MRI in cases of Congenital diaphragmatic hernia.,"We have noticed from follow up of babies who have had 2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans before they were born (fetal MRI, when mum was pregnant) for a condition called congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) that in the cases where 2 scans have been performed and there has been a reduction in the lung size that although these babies are well enough to undergo surgery after birth but that they have died unexpectedly within a few days of seemingly successful surgery. This is a pilot project that will include a fetal MRI scan all cases of CDH at the time of diagnosis (usually within a few days of the ultrasound scan performed at 20 weeks of pregnancy) as part of standard clinical care and a second fetal MRI scan in the pregnancies that continue (this will be a research scan and extra to what is offered as part of clinical care). The imaged obtained will be used to gain information on lung size. The babies notes will be reviewed after birth to find out how they are, what surgery was performed and what was found at surgery. We will use this information to see if it suggests that any change specific changes in lung size can predict how the babies will do.",Females only as this is a study in pregnancy.

2,Neoplasms,Malignant neoplasms of female genital organs,An international phase III randomised study to evaluate the efficacy of maintenance therapy with olaparib and cediranib or olaparib alone in patients with relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer following a response to platinum-based chemotherapy,"Ovarian carcinoma is the fifth commonest cause of cancer death in women in the UK. Platinum-based chemotherapy remains the cornerstone of treatment. Despite advances in treatment, about 80% of women with advanced ovarian cancer have a recurrence that is ultimately fatal. Patients who relapse > 6 months after completing first-line platinum-based chemotherapy are retreated with further platinum-based chemotherapy regimens. The median survival after first relapse is about 40 months. Two novel biological agents, cediranib targeting blood vessel growth, and olaparib targeting DNA repair processes, have individually led to an improvements in ovarian cancer control. A combination of these drugs has also demonstrated greater activity than either of them alone. The aim of the ICON9 trial is to improve progression free and overall survival by adding maintenance therapy (treatment used to slow the growth or return of cancer after initial treatment) with cediranib and olaparib in patients who have relapsed > 6 months after completing platinum-based chemotherapy. We also seek to determine the effects of treatment on the quality of life, and to find cancer markers which may help identify which treatments patients are most likely to benefit from. Patients who have responded to a minimum of 4 cycles of platinum based chemotherapy will be randomised for maintenance treatment with either olaparib and cediranib or olaparib alone. The maintenance regimen may be continued even if the disease has worsened, as indicated by CT scan, if the clinician believes the patient is still deriving benefit. Trial treatment must be discontinued if further cancer treatment is started. ICON9 will be undertaken internationally in approximately 70 sites. The target accrual is 618 patients.

It has been studied widely, largely on the basis of classifying patients based on the presence of psychosis or symptoms of psychosis. However, these classifications have been with us for decades and a more detailed understanding of the subjective experience of psychosis is essential to both understanding the lived experience of these mental health problems and refining and extending definitions for experimental investigations. This study will involve inviting patients with psychosis who are being treated by inpatient and community mental health services to complete symptom questionnaires and then open-ended interviews to discuss their lived experience of psychosis.

It causes very painful ""attacks"" of joint swelling, redness and tenderness, mostly affecting the foot, ankle, knee, hand and wrist. It is very common in people with kidney disease, who also tend to be older people with other medical conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease and diabetes. We do not know the safest and best way to treat an attack of gout in these patients. A lot of people are given treatment that can worsen their kidney disease, along with their other medical conditions. We want to compare the safest treatment currently available, steroids, with a new treatment that is being increasingly used called Anakinra. This treatment stops the action of a chemical called interleukin-1 which has been discovered to play an important role in the acute gout attack. This treatment has already been used in a handful of patients with kidney disease. We feel it may be a better alternative to steroid treatment which can worsen diabetes, and blood pressure if used for a long time. We would like to perform a scientific study comparing these two treatments. This would involve a big expensive study requiring large numbers of patients and large amounts of information to be collected. Before we do a big study like this, we want to perform a small study using smaller numbers of patients.

14,Diseases of the genitourinary system,Renal failure,Tomographic ultrasound for the detection of complications following surgically created arterio-venous fistulae for haemodialysis,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common, serious condition which affects an estimated 8.5% of the population, costing the NHS over Â£1.44 billion. As the disease progresses patients may eventually require renal replacement therapy (RRT) which is essentially to prevent the patient from becoming critically ill. Dialysis is the foremost method for RRT and a type of this, called 'haemodialysis' (HD), requires the formation of a arterio-venous fistula (AVF) - a surgically created communication between the patients artery and vein, usually in the arm. This creates an artificial high flow volume which is easily accessible for HD. However AVFs are vulnerable to damage due to the large volumes of blood travelling through them. In time, this can lead to narrowing of the AVF and eventually complete blockage, deeming it useless. The patient then needs to have another AVF created, if there is another suitable site, which leads to significant and potentially dangerous delays to their treatment. Surveillance of AVFs aims to recognise and treat the narrowing before it becomes a problem. This can be identified initially through a combination of physical examination and ultrasound. The gold standard however is through a 'fistulogram' which requires a needle puncture and the use of contrast and radiation, all of which can cause complications. As such ultrasound is used to detect the complication and the fistulagram is used as a confirmatory check which proceeds to angioplasty to resolve the problem. Tomographic Ultrasound (tUS) is fast and allows the surgeon to visualise the disease in 3D. tUS is a freehand, high resolution 3D ultrasound system which may reduce costs, radiation and contrast dosage and diagnostic angiogram waiting lists. This study aims to prove that tUS is accurate compared to clinical fistulagram results.",â¢ Clinically diagnosed fistula disease. â¢ Anastomotic stenosis diagnosed on 2D ultrasound â¢ Patients must be referred for a clinical angiogram.
5,Mental and behavioural disorders,Mental and behavioural disorders due to psychoactive substance use,SUPPORT (South Gloucestershire Pain Review Pilot) Study,"GPs have increasingly prescribed opioid painkillers, such as tramadol, for people with chronic non-cancer related pain, over the last 20 years. Chronic pain is pain that lasts longer than three months. But there is a lack of evidence showing that these painkillers can actually treat this type of pain effectively. More people are becoming addicted to opioid painkillers, and there has been a rise in the number of deaths involving these medicines. Since 2010, the rate of users of drug services mentioning use of prescription opioids has increased every year in South Gloucestershire. In 2014 the rate was six times higher than the average seen in the whole South West. The growing number of people becoming addicted to opioid painkillers is an important public health issue because it could affect people of all ages and can have serious effects on individuals, their families and society as whole. It can affect health, finances and relationships. However, patients who become dependent on prescription opioid painkillers do not want to be treated in the same specialist drug services as those taking illegal drugs, such as heroin. Guidance recommends that separate services, are provided for people who are dependent on prescription opioid painkillers. This pilot project is the first service in the UK that focuses specifically on these patients. A dedicated care worker will work with patients and GPs to treat patientsâ addiction and help GPs to reduce their prescribing of these painkillers. The pilot was launched in two local GP practices in 2016 and will run for 18 months. We plan to evaluate the pilot, examining the health and quality of life of patients. We will also talk to patients and practitioners to find out their views of the service. This evaluation will help to improve the pilot before itâs rolled out.",Service user participants will be included in the research study if they meet all the following criteria: â¢ Aged 18 years of age and above â¢ Have used prescription opioids for â¥3months â¢ Have received at least 3 opioid prescriptions in that period for Chronic Non-cancer Pain Patients Service providers will be included if they have involvement with the pilot.
13,Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue,Arthrosis,Hip Osteoarthritis treatment using Autologous Stem cell Therapy (HOAST),"We aim to investigate whether the use of stem cells taken from a patients own body for the treatment of early osteoarthritis of the hip is superior to current surgical treatment options by way of a randomized controlled trial comparing the two. Previously, the only way to surgically treat hip OA was with a joint replacement, but more and more research is being undertaken to find new ways to treat osteoarthritis earlier on in a less invasive manner, to reduce the morbidity and cost associated with the treatment of osteoarthritis. Currently, our best surgical treatment (best chondral therapy for early OA is with hip arthroscopy (key hole surgery) and microfracture, where small holes are drilled into the damaged cartilage of the hip joint to promote bleeding and scar tissue formation to form a new joint surface. We want to see if the use of stem cells, taken from a patients bone marrow in their hip at the time of surgery and then applied to the damaged cartilage surface via key hole surgery, along with microfracture, gives better results than just microfracture alone. We will be performing a smaller pilot study in order to determine the size of a full follow up study based on the results we get. This pilot will involve 40 patients, with half randomized to each treatment option (best chondral therapy vs stem cell therapy plus best chondral therapy). The patients will be adults aged 18-75 years with early osteoarthritis and no prior medical hip issues. These will be patients who were already planning on having best chondral therapy. The study will take place over 2 sites, The Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre and The Manor Hospital in Oxford. We predict the pilot phase of the study to take 1 year and the follow up study to take 2 years to complete.","â¢ Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the trial. â¢ Male of female, aged 18 to 75 years â¢ Diagnosed with focal, early hip osteoarthritis Kellgren-Lawrence Grade < 2 on preoperative imaging and Outerbridge score greater than 0. â¢ Female participants of child bearing potential and male participants whose partner is of child bearing potential must be willing to ensure that they or their partner use effective contraception during the trial and for 3 months thereafter. â¢ In the Investigatorâs opinion, is able and willing to comply with all trial requirements. â¢ Willing to allow his or her General Practitioner and consultant, if appropriate, to be notified of participation in the trial."
6,Diseases of the nervous system,Diseases of myoneural junction and muscle,Developing Raman Spectroscopy for Neuromuscular Disorders,"Disorders of nerves and muscles (often termed âneuromuscular disordersâ) can be difficult to diagnose and require several investigations, including muscle biopsy. We are investigating whether a new technique that uses a beam of light can diagnose nerve and muscle disorders. We will test the new technique on samples of muscle taken at the time of a routine biopsy. This will help us to ascertain if the technique holds promise in investigating muscle problems and can be taken forward into trials in patients.",Under investigation for a muscle disorder Suitable for muscle biopsy
13,Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue,Inflammatory polyarthropathies,Qualitative study exploring how care is planned and delivered to people living with dementia and a long-term condition,"This study is part of Jessica Reesâs PhD which seeks to understand how people with dementia are supported to look after their health when they also have a long-term health condition such as diabetes, asthma or arthritis. In this study, we plan to observe health appointments that people living with dementia attend, and meet them and their families at home. We would like to observe and talk to people living with dementia and those who support them about how they manage their physical health conditions. We will recruit GP practices and memory services through NHS trusts we have links with. Researchers will only have contact details for professionals, people with dementia and family carers who agree to be contacted. We will use participant observation to understand what is happening in practice, and qualitative interviews to understand participants experiences. Participant observation: Over a period of 3-6 months, a researcher will observe up to eight people with dementia managing their physical health. Where available, we will observe support from either family/friend carers, healthcare professionals or home care staff. In healthcare settings we will use guided observation sheets in line with NHS guidance of good dementia care. In community settings we will use unstructured field notes to record how advice received at appointments helps the management health conditions. Qualitative interviews: We will conduct qualitative interviews separate to the observational period with up to two people per care network (e.g. a person with dementia, family/friend carer, healthcare professional or homecare worker). We will ask interviewees for further details regarding events observed including participants reactions, thoughts and emotions related to events. Interviews will be conducted at a time and place convenient to participants and be based on topic guides developed from observations. The interviews will be audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed using standard qualitative techniques.",Our inclusion criteria are deliberately broad to ensure external validity. We will include: â¢ People with a documented diagnosis of dementia of any severity who have an additional diagnosed long-term condition which requires support from primary care. We will also include any stakeholder interacting with participants with dementia during the observational period: â¢ Family/friend carers who are in regular (at least monthly) contact with the person with dementia and supports the management of care activities. â¢ Home care workers who regularly work as a carer for the person with dementia and supports the management of care activities. â¢ Healthcare professionals who are involved in the care of long-term conditions for the person with dementia.
2,Neoplasms,Malignant neoplasms of female genital organs,An international field study testing the reliability and validity of the European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Communication Questionnaire (EORTC COMU26) for assessing communication between health care professionals and patients.,"Cancer and cancer treatments are frequently associated with burdensome physical, social and psychological effects. Good communication is key to informed decision making and supporting patients throughout their cancer journey. Effective health care professional-patient communication contributes to better symptom management, improves psychological functioning and quality of life. It is important that questionnaires that measure different aspects of patient health professional communication are available to inform clinical practice and identify specific training needs. More specifically these questionnaires need to be reliable and valid. Reliability relates to whether the same concept will be measured time and time again (consistency), and validity relates to whether the questionnaire is actually measuring what it says it does (appropriateness). Previous research (Phases 1 & 2)produced a list of communication issues that were seen to be relevant by cancer patients themselves. A questionnaire was constructed from these issues and the acceptableness and appropriateness of the questions tested with patients(Phase 3). The aim of this study (Phase 4) is to further test the questionnaire (EORTC COMU26), specifically looking at its reliability and validity for independent use or to be used with the previously validated general quality of life questionnaire, the EORTC-C30. Patients with different cancers and at different points in their cancer treatment and recovery will be recruited and asked to complete the two quality of life questionnaires and take part in a short interview with the researcher. The results will be analysed to see if the new instrument is reliable across cancer types, in men and women and is sensitive to change across time.","1.
