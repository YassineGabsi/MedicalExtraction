"Abnormal findings on diagnostic imaging and in function studies, without diagnosis",Checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver injury (ChILI) study,"â¢ Immune checkpoint inhibitors are proven cancer treatment drugs which have evolved over the last decade and improved outcomes in various cancers.  â¢ They work to boost the normal immune system by restoring processes which get blocked when cancer develops.  â¢ These drugs boost all the immune cells, not just the ones that can attack the cancer.   â¢ The overactive immune system following this treatment can damage the liver and other organs which can be serious. These injuries are unpredictable and difficult to treat.    â¢ Our aim is to develop new tests that can identify, predict and prevent checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver injury (ChILI) and identify the risk factors for developing this condition.  â¢ Patients with cancer who are about to start checkpoint inhibitors by oncologist or developed liver injury following the treatment will be eligible for the study.  â¢ The study will be conducted at Nottingham University Hospitals (Queens medical Centre and Nottingham City Hospital) and St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.  â¢ The study will run for 3 years.  â¢ For participants starting on check point inhibitors, we plan to see them twice (before treatment and 6- 14 weeks after).  â¢ For participants who developed liver injury they will be seen three times over 1 month (at time of reaction, 1 week after and 1 month after).  â¢ Each research visit will last around 30 minutes which involved taking medical history including medication history and collection of up to 80 mls of blood (4Â½ tablespoons) and a urine and/or stool (âpooâ) sample (urine and stool samples are optional). We will obtain consent for liver sample only if liver biopsy was clinically indicated.  â¢ Visits will be adapted to coincide with routine hospital care and clinic visits whenever possible and samples for research will be collected alongside clinical care blood tests.","Both patient groups and control group:  Aged 18 years and over.  Able to give written informed consent OR;  Potential participants who have developed encephalopathy related to ChILI as a response to checkpoint inhibitor therapy, who lack capacity to give written informed consent and have a consultee (personal or nominated) â for ChILI patient group only.    ChILI Patients:   Adults with cancer receiving checkpoint inhibitors (CTLA-4, PD-1 or PD L1 inhibitor) as monotherapy or combination (without chemotherapy) and developed acute liver injury secondary to checkpoint inhibitor and meeting the following criteria will be included:    1. Meets one of the following analytical thresholds at enrolment (visit 1):   â¢ Alanine transaminase (ALT) exceeding 5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) OR;  â¢ ALT exceeding 3 times ULN plus bilirubin exceeding 2 times ULN OR;  â¢ Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) exceeding 2 times ULN with accompanying elevations of gamma-glutamyl transferase in the absence of known bone metastases driving the rise in ALP level.  2. Absence of other known causes of liver injury after detailed investigations.    Patients who developed ChILI but did not meet the above criteria at enrolment or who were found to have different cause for their liver injury after further investigations will be excluded from analysis.      Control Group:  Consecutive patients with cancer who have clinical indication to start checkpoint inhibitors will be approached for consent to be enrolled in the study. We will enrol 120 consecutive patients who will be identified as controls. A small proportion of patients will develop ChILI following their checkpoint inhibitor treatment and will be classified as cases."
"Abnormal findings on examination of blood, without diagnosis",Exploring the patient experience of a diagnosis of pre-diabetes and factors influencing uptake of referral to a lifestyle intervention programme,"Research Question: Exploring the patient experience of a diagnosis of pre-diabetes and factors influencing uptake of referral to a lifestyle intervention programme in areas of socioeconomic deprivation.    Background: Pre-diabetes is a state in which a person's blood sugar levels are higher than normal but lower than the thresh-hold for a diagnosis of diabetes. People with pre-diabetes are at higher risk of developing diabetes than the general population. There is some evidence that lifestyle change including increased exercise, healthy diet and weight loss can reduce the risk of pre-diabetic patients developing type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Studies have suggested that patients from areas of lower socio-economic deprivation are less likely to benefit from programmes designed to encourage lifestyle change.  In the UK, general practitioners (GPs) are currently being encouraged to identify patients with pre-diabetes and refer them to a lifestyle intervention programme.    This study seeks to explore how patients in areas of socioeconomic deprivation respond to a diagnosis of pre-diabetes, what they understand by the term and whether they believe they can do anything about it. We also wish to explore what determines their decision to accept or decline referral to a lifestyle intervention programme aimed at reducing their risk of developing T2DM.  Findings from the study will help GPs have more useful conversations with their patients about pre-diabetes and may improve uptake of lifestyle intervention programmes.     Who and where: Patients registered with GPs in socioeconomically deprived areas of Sheffield who are aged 18 and over, who have been diagnosed with pre-diabetes and offered referral to a lifestyle intervention programme.      How: 20-30 patients will be interviewed. The interviews will be taped and analysed for recurring themes. The information obtained will be written up and submitted for publication in a medical journal and presented at a medical conference.",â Coded diagnosis of pre-diabetes and have been offered referral to the National Pre- Diabetes Prevention Programme.   â Aged > 18
"Abnormal findings on examination of blood, without diagnosis",Assessment of the Impact of a Personalised Nutrition Intervention in Impaired Glucose Regulation,"This study will determine if DNA-based dietary guidelines can improve glucose regulation in pre-diabetic individuals significantly more than standard dietary guidelines following 6 weeks of the intervention. This will be assessed using an oral glucose tolerance test, which is a standard clinical measurement used to assess impaired glucose regulation. Pre-diabetic individuals will be recruited by offering the opportunity to self-assess their risk score for type 2 diabetes using the Leicester Risk Score Questionnaire on the Diabetes UK website, and they can contact the clinical trial team if they are interested in participating in the trial. They will then be invited for a point of care Hba1c test to determine their suitability for the trial. The point of care Hba1c test is a simple finger prick test to assess glucose regulation.     The potential for lifestyle interventions to reduce the progression to type 2 diabetes from pre-diabetic states has been demonstrated in a number of randomised control trials (RCTs) in different countries, with a meta-analysis of RCTs suggesting that lifestyle intervention in high risk subjects can halve the incidence of diabetes. However, they have been expensive and labour intensive, with multiple personal contacts. Such intensive input is not practical on a large scale. Furthermore, DNA based dietary advice has shown a greater improvement in fasting glucose measurements in obese individuals compared to standard dietary advice, with the BMI (body mass index) only showing a long-term improvement in the group that received DNA-based dietary advice. The proposed study may be able to show that increased benefits can be obtained by following a DNA-based diet compared to standard dietary advice for pre-diabetic patients. Furthermore, the exploratory arm of the study will receive the advice via an app (provided by DnaNudge Ltd), which if effective, would demonstrate a low-cost, widely-distributable method that could be deployed to the general public without requiring individuals to self-identify as pre-diabetic to receive an intervention. The research is funded by DnaNudge Ltd.","In order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the following criteria:  â¢ Provision of signed and dated informed consent form  â¢ Adults over 18 years of age  â¢ Impaired glucose regulation including IFG and IGT by fasting glucose, OGTT or HbA1c criteria  â¢ Access to smartphone with an operating system of iOS 8.0 or above, or Android 4.0 or above."
"Abnormal findings on examination of blood, without diagnosis",Can brisk walking combined with ingestion of a lipid-lowering drug improve fat metabolism in muscle?,"The accumulation of fat in skeletal muscle is linked with insulin resistance in obesity and T2D.  However, fat also accumulates in the muscle of lean, healthy people, but they remain insulin sensitive.  This is because healthy people are able to burn this fat to generate energy during exercise.  However, overweight/obese inactive people canât use muscle fat during exercise in the same manner, which is related to the high blood lipid concentrations that are observed in these individuals.       Acipimox is a lipid-lowering agent that specifically reduces the breakdown of fat in adipose tissue and has been shown improve the blood lipid profile of obese individuals and T2D patients, at least in the short-term (1-2 weeks).  Our previous research has shown that the combination of Acipimox with exercise restores the ability of obese people to burn fat during moderate-intensity cycling exercise.  We now want to test whether Acipimox also increases the ability to burn muscle fat during low-intensity walking in people with prediabetes.  If it does, then the next step will be to test whether the combination of Acipimox and walking can lead to improved insulin sensitivity and reduced T2D risk over a longer intervention programme.      12 people with prediabetes will be recruited to undertake two experimental trials in a randomised order.  Each trial will involve walking for 45 minutes on a treadmill, with muscle biopsies obtained from the thigh before (basal), immediately following (post-exercise) and 3 h post-exercise.  Each trial will be identical, except that participants will ingest either Acipimox or a placebo in a double-blind design.  Muscle biopsies will be used to examine differences in muscle fat between the two trials.","â¢ Aged 25-55 years  â¢ BMI > 28 kg.m-2  â¢ Pre-diabetic, defined as having impaired fasting glucose (fasting glucose > = 6.1 mmol.L-1 and < = 6.9 mmol.L-1) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (plasma glucose of > = 7.8 mmol.L-1 and < 11.1 mmol.L-1 after a 2 h oral glucose tolerance test; OGTT), or a HbA1c of 42-47 mmol.mol-1.  â¢ No recent history (< 1 year) of ischaemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, or active angina.  â¢ Physically inactive (performing less than two 30 min structured exercise sessions per week for the last year)  â¢ Not pregnant (or intending to get pregnant during the study) or currently breast feeding  â¢ Pre-menopausal  â¢ Not currently involved in a weight loss programme or using weight loss medication"

We will also take muscle biopsies to investigate the mechanisms in skeletal muscle underpinning any changes in fitness and insulin sensitivity.  They will then undertake 12 weeks of steady walking (3 times per week), with each session lasting 30-50 minutes.

"Abnormal findings on examination of blood, without diagnosis",Characterisation of T cell function after surgery.,"More than 1.6 million individuals aged > 70 years undergo surgery each year in the UK, yet many struggle to return to independent function suffering increased complications after surgery, including wound infections, reduced kidney function, difficulty with their mobility. These common complications, which occur in more than 25% of those > 70 years old, lead to distressing and prolonged stays in hospital. For older individuals who leave hospital, complications after surgery are associated with much shorter life expectancy. The reasons for why postoperative complications in older people lead to delayed recovery and/or early death remain unclear.  Inflammation is a key factor in causing long-term health problems. When older individuals suffer from complications after surgery, the immune system becomes dysfunctional. This leads to higher levels of inflammation and long-term health problems, including frailty. Alterations in white blood cell count because of increased inflammation are a well recognised feature of ageing, however, it is often thought to be irrelevant. We donât think this is the case, we believe that a low WBC count is a major cause of complication following surgery. Indeed we think that higher levels of inflammation that occur during ageing cause the loss of white blood count. We know that surgery causes the energy production of a particularly type of white blood cell called a T-lymphocyte to be reduced to levels that render the cells dysfunctional and prone to dying. We also know that T-lymphocytes from older people display the same reduced energy level, what we would like to find out is whether older people with lower white blood cell counts display these energy changes delaying, full recovery and independent function.  In this study, we will measure the amount of inflammation in patients with low white cell counts before and after surgery. We will also look at changes in the energy usage in T-lymphocytes in people with low white blood counts and see if T-lymphocyte insufficiency contributes to incomplete recovery after surgery. If we can show that T-lymphocytes are damaged in patients with low white cell counts, there are a number of potential treatments that may reverse- or even prevent- these changes happening after surgery. If we can help restore the energy function of the immune system we hope to improve the chances recovering fully after major surgery.",â¢ > 55 years old.  â¢ Undergoing elective knee or hip replacement surgery.  â¢ Given written informed consent.

"Abnormal findings on examination of blood, without diagnosis","Metabolic, multi-organ and microvascular effects of a low-calorie diet in younger obese with prediabetes and/or metabolic syndrome.","Prediabetes affects around 1 in every 5 people which is usually due to being overweight or obese. As a consequence, people with prediabetes have a 5-10 times higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes (referred to as diabetes). There is often co-existing high blood pressure and/or unhealthy cholesterol levels (collectively known as the âmetabolic syndromeâ). People with metabolic syndrome are more likely to suffer from a heart attack/stroke (cardiovascular disease). In addition, many people with predates will have âfatty liver diseaseâ (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) which can result in major liver-related complications in later life.    Diabetes complications often seen at diagnosis suggesting complications may also be evident in many people at the earlier, prediabetes stage. Even when complications are not yet apparent, âpre-clinicalâ abnormalities are frequently detectable with sensitive investigations. These complications, maybe delayed, prevented or even reversed with lifestyle intervention.     Weight loss remains the most effective lifestyle intervention. Even 1 kg of weight loss reduces the progression of prediabetes to diabetes by 16%. Greater weight loss is needed to prevent other complications: 10% weight loss can cause remission of established diabetes and improve the structure of the heart while 7% weight loss can reverse liver scarring.     This study will compare the effects of a safe and effective 12-month weight management intervention, in 44 people who are obese,33 participants will using a low-calorie (~800Kcal), liquid replacement diet for 12 weeks, followed by reintroduction of a 'normal' diet and weight maintenance. In comparator, 11 people will be in a standard care that currently being delivered within National Health System (NHS) care.

Accidental poisoning by and exposure to noxious substances,A Prospective Study of Acute Severe Poisonings In Children,"Poisoning occurs when someone is exposed to a substance that can affect his or her health. Accidental or unintentional poisonings involve people poisoning themselves or others without wanting to cause harm. Accidental poisoning in children is a common reason for attendance at healthcare providers. Young children, especially those under five, have an inquisitive nature, and frequently put things found in their environment into their mouths. Teenagers involved in taking illicit drugs or alcohol are also in danger of poisoning themselves unintentionally because of their risk-taking behaviour.  Serious consequences are rare after an accidental poisoning and most children are either discharged or observed for a few hours. However, a number of children continue to suffer significant harm, with between 5 and 10 deaths each year and around 50 children admitted to intensive care within the UK. There is very little detailed data regarding serious poisoning in children in the UK.   This study, for the first time, will determine the incidence and identify the circumstances surrounding severe accidental poisoning in children under 15 years in the UK and Republic of Ireland resulting in death, or signs and symptoms of poisoning defined as needing significant monitoring or support. This is a prospective, national, surveillance cohort study, conducted in secondary care in collaboration with the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit (BPSU). Paediatricians within UK and Republic of Ireland will report cases of severe poisoning through the BPSU âorange cardâ system over a period of 13 months as part of this study.   Accidental poisoning is an avoidable problem and remains an important public health issue. It is well recognised that blanket approaches to public health campaigns are often ineffective. By identifying specific trends in severe poisonings, in particular including specific substances that frequently cause significant harm, it is hoped that these can be subsequently be targeted.",1.

Acute upper respiratory infections,MultiÂ­centre EuRopean study of MAjor Infectious Disease Syndromes (MERMAIDS): Acute Respiratory Infections in Adults,"Pathogens causing acute respiratory infections (ARI) are among themost likely candidates to cause the next pandemic. We need to better understand why some people become much more ill than others when they have an ARI.    It is likely that individual risk factors affect the bodyâs response to ARI in different ways and this in turn can influence the severity of disease. Within broad risk groups it is currently not possible to predict which individuals are at increased risk of becoming severely ill. Consequently, there are no opportunities to tailor preventive and therapeutic interventions.     In people who become moderately or severely ill, there is an assumption that the bodyâs underlying response to disease is the same and hence that everyone will benefit equally from the same treatments. Increased insight into how different individuals respond to respiratory pathogens can allow us to better anticipate severity at individual patient levels. This in turn will enable us to formulate strategies for individualized treatment   options to reduce disease severity, risk of complications and hospitalisations.    In this study we will recruit people attending primary and secondary care in order to capture people with mild to severe ARI.   We will analyse samples to observe individual gene activity and we will compare samples from people with different risk factors for more severe disease. This will provide a detailed insight into how the   body responds to infection and provide opportunities to understand the specific contributions of different risk factors","Inclusion Criteria Group 1 â Primary Care Patients    1) Age â¥ 18 years    2) Patient is selfÂ­-attending to primary care (i.e. ambulatory)    3) Clinical suspicion of a new episode of acute respiratory tract infection    4) Onset of the following symptoms, within the last 7 days:    i.i.

Acute upper respiratory infections,Analysis of bacterial carriage and antibiotic resistance rates in the upper respiratory tract. (Solent SMART pilot study),"Upper respiratory tract infections such as otitis media (middle ear infection), sinusitis (inflammation of the nasal sinus) and pneumonia account for considerable morbidity. Such infections can lead to meningitis (inflammation of the membranes lining the skull), sepsis (blood infection) and even death, particularly in young children and the elderly. The nasopharynx is thought to be the main source of invasive bacterial infection caused by bacteria such as S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus and M. catarrhalis. Antibiotic resistance is a growing health crisis. Approximately 25,000 people die every year in Europe because of infections related to antibiotic resistance. The cost associated with these bacterial infections, in hospital costs and productivity losses alone, exceeded Â£1 billion each year in Europe.     The aim of the study is to sample bacteria from the upper respiratory tract (URT), in order to determine community carriage levels of common respiratory pathogens and the prevalence of antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic disc diffusion tests will be used to analyse the antibiotic resistance of bacteria to commonly prescribed antibiotics.     Individuals of all ages, attending any participating sites working in partnership with the Solent NHS Trust, will be approached on the day of their visit by a member of the research team. Potential participants will be given an information sheet and time to read it and ask any questions before they are asked to complete a consent form and questionnaire. Participants will then have swabs taken from their nasopharynx (back of the nose) and oropharynx (back of the throat) and will be asked to have a further optional nasal swab. Swabs will be taken by a member of the research team who have undertaken relevant training.     All swabs will be analysed in the laboratory using traditional diagnostic microbiology techniques. Bacterial isolates will be stored in microbial storage and tested for antimicrobial resistance using disc diffusion methods.","Any individual of any age who is willing to participate and able to give informed consent or whose parent/guardian is willing to give consent on their behalf. It is the responsibility of the clinical staff or member of the research team to assess if the potential participants, or the parent/guardian, have understood what is going to happen and are capable of giving informed consent. If the clinical staff or member of the research staff feel this is not the case then they can decide not to include the potential participant in the study. All staff have been fully trained in recruitment and informed consent."
Acute upper respiratory infections,Pragmatic randomised controlled trial of molecular point-of-care testing for respiratory viruses versus routine clinical care in adults with severe acute respiratory illness: a pilot study (SARIPOC),"Acute respiratory tract infections are responsible for over 4 million deaths each year and are the third most common cause of death worldwide. Respiratory viruses are the most common detectable pathogen in adults with acute respiratory infection.    Influenza and other respiratory virus infections often remain undiagnosed in patients admitted to critical care due to lack of systematic testing. Even when testing occurs, treatment is often delayed because of slow turnaround times of laboratory methods.    Treatment for influenza in hospitalised adults with neuraminidase inhibitors (e.g. Tamiflu / oseltamivir) is recommended by national guidelines. Prompt treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors reduces the risk of death.    Point-of-care tests (POCT) for respiratory viruses, with antigen detection-based assays, have been limited in clinical practice by unacceptably low sensitivities and by an inadequate range of detectable viruses. Newer molecular systems, such as the FilmArray Respiratory Panel have comparable sensitivity to laboratory tests, detect a wide range of viruses, and can generate a result in about an hour, making them deployable as POCTs.    We propose a single-centre, pilot, randomised controlled trial in adults with acute severe respiratory illness admitted to critical care (respiratory high dependency unit and intensive care units) at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust. 300 patients over three years will be recruited and randomised (1:1) to receive either the intervention of a nose and throat swab, immediately tested on the FilmArray Respiratory Panel, or standard clinical care alone. Those allocated to standard clinical care will have a swab taken for later analysis to allow assessment of missed diagnoses. The outcomes assessment will be by retrospective case note analysis. The outcome measures include the proportion of influenza-positive patients appropriately treated with neuraminidase inhibitors, antibiotic use, isolation facility use, length of stay in critical care and length of stay in hospital.","- Admitted to the Respiratory High Dependency Unit (RHDU), or an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), or about to be transferred to either RHDU or ICU, or under the care of the RHDU or ICU team in another hospital area, within University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust (UHS)    - Aged > = 18 years old    - Duration of respiratory illness less than 10 days prior to hospitalisation      - Presented to hospital less than 72 hours prior to enrolment    - Has a severe acute respiratory illness*    *An episode of severe acute respiratory illness is defined as an acute pulmonary illness (including pneumonia, bronchitis and influenza-like illness) or an acute exacerbation of a chronic respiratory illness (including exacerbation of COPD, asthma or bronchiectasis), requiring high dependency or intensive care.

Acute upper respiratory infections,REspiratory Syncytial virus Consortium in EUrope (RESCEU) study: Defining the burden of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) disease.,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes severe respiratory disease in babies, the elderly and high-risk groups.  In 2005 itâs estimated that RSV was associated with 3.4 million acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) hospitalisations and between 55,000 - 199,000 deaths in children under 5 years worldwide, most in developing countries.  In the UK up to 1 in 25 of all children born each year are hospitalised due to RSV infection. Knowing the healthcare and societal costs associated with RSV infection are essential to decide which future treatments and preventatives to use.  This study will determine the burden of RSV disease in at least 2000 healthy infants, to be recruited into one of two cohorts:   1. Passive (at least 1800): Demographic data will be collected at inclusion and a parental questionnaire at one year of age.  Babies admitted to a hospital for an ARTI will be followed up to the age of 3 years.  2.  Active (at least 200): At inclusion demographic data and the following samples will be taken; blood, a swab from the back of the nose, stool and urine samples from the nappy.  During the RSV season (Oct to March) in first year of life, parents will be contacted weekly to monitor respiratory symptoms. If the infant has an ARTI they will be visited to test (by a nose swab) if the illness is due to RSV.  If positive, samples as above will be taken and repeated 7 weeks later.  There will be ongoing weekly contact enquiring of further ARTIs.  Visits to determine if any respiratory illness is due to RSV continue throughout infantsâ first RSV season.  Participants are followed annually by questionnaire.  Data collected in this study and similar studies in sites across Europe will be combined to provide data on 10,000 healthy infants.","- Healthy* children, gestation age at least 37+0 weeks, born at participating centres.   - Written informed consent obtained from mothers.  - Parents able and willing to adhere to protocol-specified procedures (active cohort)."
Acute upper respiratory infections,Biomarker-guided duration of Antibiotic Treatment in Children Hospitalised with confirmed or suspected bacterial infection (The BATCH trial),"Sepsis defined as the bodyâs response to infection, and is often indistinguishable from the response to other insults like burns or surgery. Giving antibiotics promptly saves lives, but giving antibiotics to people who donât need them, leads to overuse of antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Department of Health recommends that antibiotics should be given for as short a course as is safe, to prevent AMR.    Most hospitals in the NHS use a C-Reactive Protein (CRP) blood test to monitor response to infection, but it is not specific for bacterial infection and shows a delayed response to infection. Procalcitonin is a blood test which is specific for bacterial infection and responds more quickly than CRP, but is not routinely used in the NHS. Studies done mainly in adults shows that using procalcitonin to guide clinicians may reduce the amount of antibiotics used, reduce hospital stay, and is not associated with adverse effects such as hospital re-admission, incomplete treatment of infections, relapse or death.     BATCH aims to assess the use of an additional PCT test in children (aged < 18 years) hospitalised with suspected or confirmed bacterial infection to guide antimicrobial prescribing decisions. Children will be recruited from Paediatric wards or Paediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs).    In children randomised to the intervention arm, a PCT test will be performed in the hospital laboratory at baseline, Day 3-5, Day 6-14 and Day 28 (if still on IV antibiotics)(aligned with normal clinical workflow and routine laboratory testing). Children in the control arm will not have a PCT test performed.     Outcome data will be recorded daily by the Research Nurse (up to and including day 28, or until discharge). Day 28 follow up will be conducted with parents via telephone/email.     The study comprises an internal pilot with 6 lead sites. Additional sites will be added as required.

Acute upper respiratory infections,"A multicentre prospective, observational, longitudinal cohort study in adult patients with suspected Upper or Lower Respiratory infection (URTI/LRTI) to identify a spectrum of biomarkers in exhaled breath to discriminate participants with bacterial RTI from participants without.","This multicentre prospective, observational, longitudinal cohort study aims to obtain chemical information of exhaled breath biomarker data from adult patients with suspected Upper and Lower Respiratory pathologies (URTI/LRTI) to support clinical decision making regarding the diagnosis and treatment of suspected RTI.  Patients with suspected RTI who consent to participate in the study will be asked to provide one complete breath sample directly into each of two different BreathspecÂ® instruments by exhaling into a disposable mouthpiece for 3-5 seconds. Subjects will be asked to swill their mouth with water immediately before taking the test.  An ambient air sample will be collected after each breath sample. Analysis of a sample (breath or ambient air) will take less than 10 minutes. The participant does not need to be present for this analysis.  The results of the gas phase chemical analysis will be stored in the internal memory of each device for subsequent downloading and analysis.   Patients will be assessed and treated at the study sites as per best practice for the diagnosis and treatment of RTIs.",Male and female subjects aged 18 and above will be eligible for inclusion in this study if all the following criteria apply:  - Present with symptoms indicative of a suspected RTI   - Willing and competent to provide informed written consent
Acute upper respiratory infections,A clinical effectiveness investigation of a multi-faceted intervention (incorporating a prognostic algorithm) to improve management of antibiotics for CHIldren presenting to primary care with acute COugh and respiratory tract infection (CHICO): an efficient cluster RCT informed by a feasibility RCT,"TITLE: A clinical effectiveness investigation of a clinician decision aid to improve management of antibiotics for children (aged 0-9 years) presenting to GP practices with a cough/respiratory tract infections (RTIs)    BACKGROUND: Coughs and colds (RTIs)  are the most common reason that children visit GP surgeries.  Clinicians (doctors and nurses) are not always sure how best to treat them and often use antibiotics âjust in caseâ.  There are concerns that clinicians use antibiotics too often and that this is increasing the number of resistant bugs (bacteria that are not killed by antibiotics).     From a 5 year programme of NIHR funded work, the research team have developed an intervention that helps clinicians to know which children are very unlikely to benefit from an antibiotic.     The intervention includes a decision aid which lets the clinician know if a child is likely to get well without antibiotics (the tool provides information, but the clinician still makes the final decision on the treatment received, based on what they believe is in the childâs best interests). Clinicians will listen to parentsâ concerns and giving them a personalised leaflet with care and safety advice.    AIM: The main aim of the study is to see if our intervention is effective, safe and easy to use.      THE STUDY: 310 GP practices will take part in the study for 12-months.  Half of the practices will use the intervention and half will continue with their usual care.  Data collected will be used to work out if antibiotic dispensing levels are different between the practices using the intervention compared to those that do not. We are also interested in whether the hospitalisation rates remain the same in both groups of practices.     Data will be collected on children aged 0-9 years old     The study is being run by researchers at the University of Bristol.  Funding: HTA NIHR","This trial is conducted at the GP practice level, with practices being randomised to using the intervention or standard care.      Practices included in the trial will be those using the EMISWeb medical record management computer software to house the intervention (53% of English practices use this system).      The research team are also proposing a scoping exercise in the first few months of the study to look at the potential barriers of embedding our intervention in different practice systems. Potentially the research team may recruit practices with systems other than EMIS or at least report on the difficulties that need to be overcome if the intervention is rolled out.    Within practices, the patient-group of interest are children aged 0-9 years, that present with an RTI during the data collection period.  The research team will be collecting anonymised data on individuals and this will be gathered using current NHS routine systems."
Acute upper respiratory infections,To optimise the SNIFS instruction materials to ensure that they are engaging and acceptable for patients with recurrent sinusitis.,"Acute sinusitis is one of the commonest infections managed in primary care.  Saline nasal irrigation involves rinsing the sinuses through the nose with saline (salt) solution. A large study in people with chronic sinusitis showed that most people can do nasal irrigation with simple advice, find it acceptable and will keep doing it over weeks. However, nasal irrigation could be made even more effective by dealing with key problems some people have.     The SNIFS instructions will help patients to use saline nasal irrigation to improve their quality of life with recurrent sinusitis. Paper version and DVD-based versions of the SNIFS materials have already been tested in a large study in 72 GP practices, with patients who used saline irrigation reporting reduced symptoms and being less likely to go to the doctor.     This study will update these paper and DVD instructions to be accessible online. We will ask 10-15 patients with recurrent sinusitis (from 4 local GP practices) to try the materials, and suggest ways that they can be improved. We will ensure that the participants we ask to take part are diverse in order to accurately reflect likely patients.     Participants in this study will appraise the materials however we will not be asking them to engage in the intervention (i.e. conduct saline irrigation). After each patient has used the materials, we will address any points that they have raised, and ask the next patient to review the updated website. When participants no longer suggest any issues that need to be addressed, we will consider the materials to be âoptimisedâ.    The effectiveness of these materials will later be tested in a planned trial (for which we will submit a further ethics application once we have developed these new materials).",â¢ Over age 18  â¢ Fluent English speaking  â¢ Attending primary care with recurrent sinusitis  â¢      Able to provide informed consent
Acute upper respiratory infections,The RAPID-TEST study: Novel upper respiratory tract microbiological point-of-care diagnostics in people presenting to primary care with acute respiratory tract infection: a quantitative and qualitative feasibility study,"Every year, millions of people visit general practitioners (GPs) with coughs, colds, and throat, ear and chest infections. GPs give antibiotics to lots of people they see with these infections, to try to stop them getting sicker, but antibiotics only help a small number of people. The problem is knowing who these people are.    Unfortunately, using lots of antibiotics eventually makes antibiotics stop working. So, it is important antibiotics are only used where we are sure they will work.     Respiratory infections are caused by germs infecting the airways. Antibiotics only work if infections are caused by a type of germ called bacteria, but most infections are caused by other germs called viruses. It would help if GPs could tell which infections are caused by bacteria.    Machines are being developed which could help GPs. These âpoint-of-careâ tests use samples of mucous and saliva from the nose and back of the throat and give results quickly, allowing GPs to see if viruses and/or bacteria are present.     This study will involve GP practices being given one such machine, called 'FilmArray' for two months. 'FilmArray' has been developed, validated and CE marked for the purpose of detecting respiratory germs by an established company called Biomerieux (see www.biomerieux.com). We will ask GPs and nurses looking after patients with respiratory infections to invite them to take part, and see if using the test changes treatment, how it the test fits into the flow of appointments, and what other information they need to use them. This study is necessary because these tests have never been used by GPs before.    Results from this feasibility study will help us design a large GP study of point-of-care tests for respiratory infections, which will tell us if these new tests could help the NHS safely reduce antibiotic use.","Inclusion criteria for patient participants are:    â¢ Adults and children aged > = 3 months being assessed (face-to-face) for symptoms of acute (< = 28 days) respiratory tract infection as identified by the recruiting clinician (GPs and nurses), including sore throat/pharyngitis/laryngitis, acute middle ear infections (acute otitis media), acute cough/chest/lower respiratory tract infections, and infective exacerbation of asthma/ chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)    â¢ Clinician wishes to use the point-of-care test    Inclusion criterion for primary care staff participants in qualitative evaluation is:    â¢ Primary care staff who has some involvement in using point-of-care test"
Acute upper respiratory infections,Saline Nasal Irrigation For acute Sinusitis II RCT,"Acute sinus infections are one of the commonest infections managed in primary care, Currently GPs prescribe antibiotics to most  patients presenting with sinusitis, the highest of any of the common acute infections presenting in adults, at over 90%.The trouble with prescribing for most people is that we are using antibiotics too much which is causing the bacteria to become resistant, which is likely to lead in the future to  serious infections  becoming untreatable from âsuperbugsâ. Alternatives to the initial management with antibiotics are needed.  Previous studies have tried nasal irrigation using salt solution for colds but the studies are small and not conclusive. There have also been studies of nasal irrigation in chronic sinus  infections which do show some benefit. A large study in chronic or recurrent sinusitis in primary care showed that most people can learn to do nasal irrigation with simple advice and a short video to show how it is done, find it acceptable and will keep doing it over several weeks. However, there was some evidence that the approach to help people use nasal irrigation could be made more effective, dealing with key barriers or difficulties more effectively. There have been no good studies of saline irrigation in acute sinusitis.  The first part of the proposed study over a few months and will optimise the intervention, by working with patients on a 1:1 basis. This will make sure we are providing all the necessary advice and materials to help engage patients and to deal with any issues or problems they might have.  The study will then randomise more than 100 people with acute sinus infections presenting in primary care to either a) immediate antibiotics (current usual treatment in primary care) or b) advice to do nasal irrigation for up to 3 weeks with a âback-upâ or delayed antibiotic prescription (a prescription that can be used if the sinusitis does not settle). Participants will fill out a daily symptom diary which will allow us to see whether irrigation makes any difference to symptom severity, or to the duration of illness,and whether antibiotic were used.   Participants who are happy to have further tests will have a swab of the nose.   This study will provide evidence of recruitment and follow-up rates, and is also likely to provide  preliminary evidence about whether antibiotic use is likely to be reduced, in order to provide sufficient evidence for a larger application for a full trial.","We will pragmatically define acute sinusitis as having sinus discomfort, and at least 2 other symptoms (2 of: patient reported nasal obstruction, patient reported purulent nasal discharge, or pus seen in the nasal cavity on inspection by the clinician). We do not propose using prior duration (e.g. the requirement for at least 7 days without improvement in the Canadian guidelines) since there is no good evidence for a particular cut-off, and our aim is to help people who are currently being treatment with antibiotics for sinusitis, many of whom present with 7 days."
Acute upper respiratory infections,"A double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, feasibility trial evaluating the possibility of delivering Andrographis paniculata  (Immunographis) as a treatment of adults with Acute Respiratory Tract Infections (ARTIs)","Acute respiratory infections (such as cough, sore throat and sinusitis) are common and therefore distressing and costly both for individuals and the NHS. Antibiotics have limited benefits and have side effects.    A herbal medicine called Andrographis Paniculata is a promising candidate to treat acute respiratory tract infections.  In a systematic review of randomised controlled trials Andrographis performed better than placebo after 5 days  We propose to evaluate the feasibility of using Andrographis capsules in adults who visit their GP with an acute respiratory tract infection symptom and where the GP thinks the symptoms are caused by an infection  (bacterial or viral) but NOT pneumonia. The doctor will be able to prescribe antibiotics if needed either taken immediately or delayed for a few days.","Patients will eligible for the trial if they are over 18 years of age and present to their GP with a potential ARTI. Adults 18 years and over presenting with an acute cough (< = 28 days' duration) as their main symptom and with symptoms localising to the upper respiratory tract (e.g. sore throat,headache,runny nose, muscle ache), for which non-infective diagnoses are judged very unlikely."
Acute upper respiratory infections,Regulation of Immunoglobulin class switching,"We wish to investigate how B cells regulate the process of immunoglobulin class switching in order to produce the appropriate type of antibody required to neutralise the particular infection they face.    All the experiments planned in this study will be carried out on B cells isolated from the tonsils and adenoids of patients (adults and children) undergoing routine tonsillectomies and adenoidectomies at Guyâs and St. Thomas NHS Foundation trust. Patients (and/or their legal guardians) will be approached by a member of the research team following admittance to the ward for surgery. Patients (and their legal guardians) will be given a copy of an information sheet to read, describing the purpose of our research and what will happen to them should they take part in the study, and asked to give their consent to be included. The researcher will be available at this time to answer any questions that may arise.    If consent is given the patients will be asked to fill out a short questionnaire (no more than 5 minutes). The answers to these questions will allow us to determine whether the participant falls into our ânormalâ or asthmatic/allergic group, ensure that they donât suffer from any other immune system diseases, they havenât got any long standing illness and they donât take any medicine that may affect the way in which their B cells respond in our experiments. This will end the participantâs involvement in this project: They will not be approached for any further questions or asked to give any other samples. Inclusion in this project will not affect the way in which the tonsillectomy surgery is performed or their treatment afterwards.     Following normal removal of the tonsils (and adenoids, if collected), our researchers will collect the discarded tissue and isolate the B cells from it for use in subsequent experiments. B cells will be isolated by density gradient centrifugation, following maceration of the tonsil. B cells will then be isolated by FACS sorting. The B cells will be treated with either IL-4, IFN-ï§ or TGF-ï¢ in conjunction with reagents to mimic CD40 signalling to stimulate them to undergo class switching to the different antibody isotypes. At various time points cells will be collected and analysed as described below. No tissue or cells will be stored following this procedure, however, DNA or proteins from the cells may be stored for use in subsequent experiments. All retained DNA/proteins will be stored in freezers (monitored with alarms) located in the Dept. of Respiratory medicine and Allergy.

Acute upper respiratory infections,Platform randomised controlled trial of point of care diagnostics for enhancing the quality of antibiotic prescribing for community acquired acute respiratory tract infection in ambulatory care in Europe,"The discovery of antibiotics was a major breakthrough in medical science. Antibiotics are used to treat illness caused by bacteria. Development of these medicines meant that illnesses, like pneumonia, which were once often fatal, could be successfully treated, saving millions of lives. But their effectiveness has decreased because they are misused. Highly resistant âsuperbugsâ have appeared against which we have no effective treatment. The development of antibiotic resistance is now a major public health concern worldwide.   Bacteria that are exposed to insufficient antibiotic can change and become resistant to their killing effects. Another cause of resistance is when antibiotics are prescribed when there is no evidence to prove which micro-organism is causing a patientâs symptoms. Clinical studies have shown that confirming a patient is more likely to be infected with a bacterium (or not) before prescribing an antibiotic by using a point-of-care test in a doctorâs surgery could help improve the quality of patient care and aid recovery. This is especially true for community-acquired acute respiratory tract infections (CA-ARTI), the commonest reasons for consulting health services in the community and for antibiotic use.  The aim of PRUDENCE is to determine if there is added value provided by having a CA-ARTI diagnostic (CA-ARTI-Dx) test done in the surgery to give a quick result. Then the result is available when a clinician is considering, or plans to prescribe an antibiotic, which could lead to more appropriate prescribing decisions, without causing harm to patients.    The study will be a pragmatic, platform, randomised controlled trial of point-of-care diagnostics, evaluated over two seasons of increased community acquired acute respiratory tract infections, in up to 10 European countries starting in January 2021.","â¢ Male or Female, aged 1 year or above  â¢ Consulting with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection where cough is the predominant symptom (< 28 days); or, symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection (< 14 days) where sore throat is the dominant symptom; and where the clinician is considering/has decided to prescribe an antibiotic  â¢ Is able and willing to comply with all trial requirements  â¢ Participant or legal guardian(s) of a child is willing and able to give informed consent according to national regulations"
Acute upper respiratory infections,Understanding general practitionersâ views and experiences of using clinical prediction rules in the management of respiratory infections: a qualitative study,"Inappropriate use of antibiotics continues to contribute to bacteria becoming resistant to treatment. A number of guidance sheets have been developed to help doctors decide when it is appropriate to prescribe antibiotics for respiratory tract infections such as sore throat, but it is not clear if they use these in their decision-making process. Limited evidence suggests doctors may not be familiar with these guidance sheets or prefer to use their own clinical judgement. Our study aims to explore UK doctorsâ views and experiences of using these (electronic) guidance sheets for respiratory tract infections. We will interview about 25-30 doctors from a range of urban, rural, large and small practices and with a mix of gender, age and years of experience, over the phone. We will ask them questions about barriers and facilitators of using these sheets during consultations. We will also explore whether uptake varies with years of clinical experience and across practices. The findings of the study will improve our understanding of reasons for using or not using guidance sheets and will allow more acceptable guidance sheets to be developed in the future to encourage more widespread adoption by doctors in practice. This in turn will reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing and resistant bacteria.",Qualified GPs currently working in hours in a general practice surgery and working with patients with RTIs.
Acute upper respiratory infections,PREparing for Improving the use of NHS primary care services and Antibiotics for children with respiratory Tract infections,"Respiratory tract infections (RTI) are common childhood illnesses. RTIs are the most common reason for child visits to primary care and also the most common reason for children to be given antibiotics. Most RTIs will get better without treatment, but a small minority develop into a more severe illness. Too many antibiotics are prescribed for childrenâs RTIs, contributing to the rise of antibiotic resistant bacteria. We propose to conduct interviews with clinicians to identify the optimal characteristics of an online tool for both parents and clinicians. During interview with primary care clinicians (GP and practice nurses) we will discuss the potential for incorporating a web-tool into their systems for a) supporting evidence-based antibiotic prescribing by clinicians and b) providing better information to parents about managing RTI in children, including supporting parents to decide when to seek an appointment or treatment. The Pre-INACT study will (overall) involve three research activities. The first a systematic review, followed by focus group sessions with parents. We are not seeking NHS ethics/HRA approval for the focus group sessions as this will be done in community settings with pre-existing parent groups. We are however seeking ethical consideration for this component of the Pre-INACT study from the University of Bristol's faculty of Medicine and Dentistry. We therefore wish to apply for HRA approval for up to 30 qualitative interviews with primary care staff (GPs/Practice Nurses and other associated healthcare professionals). These interviews will be conducted on NHS premises with the support of the local Clinical Research Networks (CRN).",Recruitment of clinician participants We will aim to recruit clinicians (GPs/practice nurses/and other associated staff) from practices serving different populations to reflect a mix of social/economic and ethic groups.
Acute upper respiratory infections,Reducing recurrent respiratory infections in primary care: The Immune Defence Study,"A range of viruses circulate each winter and cause respiratory infections (RTIs) (the viruses that causes colds, sore throats, sinus, chest or ear infections, flu). These can lead to people being off work, to seeking help from the NHS, and to be admitted to hospital in winter months. The combined effect of both the normal winter viruses (and also the COVID virus in the current pandemic) are likely to cause major problem for the NHS not only during the coming 2020-21 winter season but in subsequent years. There is promising evidence that using nasal sprays, or alternatively reducing stress and increasing exercise, could help peopleâs immune defences, reduce the number of people getting infections, reduce how severe illnesses are and how long they last. The NIHR has funded the RECUR Programme to develop and trial interventions to find out if they reduce the incidence of infections. We have developed a website called Immune Defence which will help us to see if using nasal sprays or getting more physically active and reducing stress can help people get fewer and less severe infections. We have involved both a range of patients and also patient representatives as collaborators in the design of our study to help ensure the procedures are relevant and appropriate to patients. We had planned a large feasibility study this year in the 2020-21 winter season, and a full trial in a ânormalâ year in the 2021-2023 winter seasons. However, the stage of development this year and our previous experience of running large similar trials suggests that instead of the feasibility study we can move to a larger full trial straight away among at risk groups so that we generate a sizeable sample during the pandemic. This study will involve approximately 200 GP practices and up to 15000 patients who are at risk from respiratory infections. Patients will be invited to take part in the study through invitation letters from their GP surgery. Those who are interested in taking part will be asked to register online and to answer some questions to ensure the study is right for them. Eligible patients will be randomised to one of the following groups for 12 months: i) A microgel nasal spray ii) Saline nasal spray, iii) Getting Active and Reducing Stress or iv) Usual Care. Participants will be asked to complete monthly questionnaires for 6 months, and more detailed questionnaires at 3, 6 and 12 months about any infections and about their general health. Patients happy to do so will complete a daily diary of symptoms if they do become unwell to give a more detailed understanding of the course of each illness.

Aplastic and other anaemias,Phase I study of transfer of effector memory T cells (Tem) following allogeneic stem cell transplantation.,"Healthy bone marrow produces blood cells, including infection-fighting immune cells. These blood cells originate from stem cells. In cancer, the bone marrow can no longer function properly. To restore healthy blood cell production and to fight the cancer, some patients are given healthy stem cells from a donorâs bone marrow. Although this can cure many patients, it can have serious side effects, including âgraft versus host diseaseâ (GvHD). This happens because the bone marrow contains donor immune cells (the âgraftâ) that see the patientâs healthy cells (the âhostâ) as foreign and attacks them. It mainly affects the tissues of the skin, the liver and the gut and can be life threatening. Drugs that prevent GvHD by suppressing the donorâs immune cells in the patientâs body renders the immune system weak and unable to fight infections. These infections are sometimes very severe and can lead to patients dying.     This trial aims to find out if giving patients additional infection fighting immune cells from the donor (Tem cells) will reduce their chance of getting an infection without causing GvHD.    Patients will receive additional donor immune cells about one month after the transplant. They will also receive the standard GvHD prevention treatment. Different doses of the donor immune cells will be given to individual patients to work out which dose is best. All patients will be closely monitored for signs of GvHD or infection. They will also have blood tests to determine how well and quickly their immune systems recover. Patients will be followed up for 12 months post treatment.    The study will recruit a maximum of 18 patients.

Aplastic and other anaemias,"Project Aura: Co-design of a home monitoring solution for patients with anaemia of chronic kidney disease, carers and healthcare professionals to optimise delivery of treatment","The study is sponsored by Entia and funded by Innovate UK. This project is a co-design initiative between the investigator team, patients, carers, and health professionals at Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust.    Entia, in partnership with Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust will develop a patient monitoring solution to optimise delivery of specialist care.  As a part of this service, a medical device will be co-designed which is capable of performing a haemoglobin and haematocrit measurement from a small amount of blood. We hope through this technology to improve the experience of receiving treatment for patients and their carers whilst helping healthcare professionals to plan and manage the care of patients undergoing ESA therapy.    In order to ensure a user-friendly design that meets end user needs, we propose to develop the solution using a co-design model. Patients and carers, along with healthcare professionals and innovators, are all partners in this design process.

Arthropod-borne viral fevers and viral haemorrhagic fevers,Evaluating the Long Term Immunogenicity of  Ebola Virus Vaccines Ad26-ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo,"This study proposes to investigate whether the immune response generated following vaccination with various prime boost regimes of the Ad26-ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo Ebola vaccines is preserved in the long-term. In this study, we aim to assess persistence of humoral and cellular immunity between 24 and 30 months and 36 to 42 months from the date a participant received their prime vaccine.    The humoral response will be assessed by estimating the neutralizing IgG antibodies to the Ebola GP using an in-house ELISA technique. The cellular immune response will be assessed by assessing pro-inflammatory cytokine release by CD8+ and CD4+ T cells using staining techniques on a multicolour flow cytometer platform.     We will also carry out additional tests for cellular immunity, such as IFN-gamma release by Ebola-specific GP-specific T cells by the ELISpot assay. We will store the remaining PBMCs under appropriate conditions for this purpose.","Willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the study  -Male or female, aged 18 or above.  -Subject must have received both vaccines in the phase I trial (14/SC/1408).  -Agree to allow his or her GP (and/or consultant, if appropriate) to be notified of participation in the study if required."
Arthropod-borne viral fevers and viral haemorrhagic fevers,A phase I study to determine the safety and immunogenicity of the candidate Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV) vaccine ChAdOx1 Chik in healthy adult volunteers,"The purpose of this study is to test a new vaccine against the Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV) in healthy volunteers.   Chikungunya fever is a disease caused by CHIKV and it is transmitted to humans through a mosquito bite.  It has been identified in over 100 countries, causing approximately 1 million cases  worldwide. The disease typically consists of an acute illness characterised by fever, skin rash, muscle aches and severe joint pains (which are often incapacitating), lasting weeks to months.  There are currently no available treatments or licensed vaccines and strategies tackling the control of the mosquito are extremely difficult to implement. Fatal cases are rare, but they have been observed in new-born and elderly individuals, as well as in those with medical conditions such as diabetes or cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurologic disorders     The study will enable us to assess the safety of the new vaccine called ChAdOx1 Chik and the extent of the immune response in healthy volunteers. We will do this by giving participants one dose of the vaccine in addition to doing blood tests and collecting information about any symptoms that occur after vaccination. In this study, healthy adult volunteers will receive a single dose of a new candidate vaccine at different doses. The objective of this first-in-human study is to find the optimal dose of the vaccine, balancing immune responses and profile of adverse events.  Healthy volunteers aged 18-50 will be recruited in Oxford and vaccinated at the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine and will be followed for a period of 6 months. The study is funded by the UK innovation agency - Innovate UK and the Department of Health.","The volunteer must satisfy all the following criteria to be eligible for the study:    1.

Arthropod-borne viral fevers and viral haemorrhagic fevers,Vaccine immunogenicity using tuberculosis and dengue fever as models,"It is estimated that in 2015, 10.4 million people were infected with tuberculosis. Dengue Fever infects an estimated 390 million people each year. The current vaccine against TB, the BCG vaccine, and the Dengvaxia vaccine against dengue, only offer partial protection. New vaccines against TB and dengue are urgently needed.   We are testing the effectiveness of new vaccines against tuberculosis and Dengue Fever.  For this project we use tonsils maintained in the laboratory to mimic immune system. These tonsils are used as a platform for testing new vaccines. Human tissue from tonsils is a good model of the complex interactions required to control infectious diseases.   Mice are usually used to test new vaccines. Unfortunately, mice and humans mount different immune responses against tuberculosis. This work will test whether cell lines and human tissue could be a useful alternative to the use of animals in experiments.  Vaccines work by stimulating the immune responses. All vaccines generate different immune responses. To determine which vaccines will be protective, we are measuring the activation of immune cells. We are also monitoring the production of cytokines, which cells use to signal to each other. We are gathering information on the levels of antibody generated by each vaccine. We also measure the survival of immune cells and the elimination of Tuberculosis bacteria.  Testing these parameters for all the vaccines currently in development should allow us to select the most effective new vaccines.","Patients undergoing tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy or uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, as treatment for breathing problems, obstructive sleep apnoea, inflamed tonsils, cancer of the tonsils will be considered potential participants.

We will first separate the tumour into single cells before infecting these specimens with Zika virus tagged with a marker so we can see which cells are infected by it. Following this we will use techniques to characterise the target cell for the virus. We also plan to infect tumour slices for staining.    No additional tissue will be removed from the patient and only tissue surplus to the needs for pathological analysis will be used. Fragments of tissue will  include:  a) Normal brain tissue resected by necessity in the course of the approach to the lesion  b) Lesion margins  c) Lesion bulk  These tissue types may be obtained directly from the surgical field, or indirectly by collecting the waste products from the ultrasonic tissue ablation apparatus used at operation.",Neurosurgery for intrinsic brain tumour necessitating resection.
Arthropod-borne viral fevers and viral haemorrhagic fevers,Evaluating the Long Term Immunogenicity of Ad / MVA Ebola Virus Vaccines following late boosting with AD26.ZEBOV vaccine administered after heterologous prime/boost schedules of adenoviral and MVA vectored Ebola vaccines: an open-label clinical trial,"This study will evaluate the duration of the immune response of a late booster dose of a vaccine against Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), AD26.ZEBOV, in healthy adults previously immunised with investigational Ebola vaccine schedules. This will generate data crucial to the understanding of persistence of immunity after initial immunisation, and whether a late booster dose confers additional benefit in long term persistence of immunity. These data are critical in informing the potential for the investigational vaccines schedules to provide sustained immunity to those at ongoing risk of EVD (e.g. health care workers) and whether this can be significantly altered by the additional dose of AD26.ZEBOV.    To achieve this, participants who have completed previous Phase 1 and 2 Ebola  vaccine studies in the UK including EBL01 (REC 14/SC/1256), EBL04 (REC 15/SC/0108) and EBL05 (REC 15/SC/0267) led by the Oxford Vaccine Centre, will be invited to participate in these âfollow-onâ studies, in which blood tests will be taken at 2 to 5 years after initial immunisation. Participants who are willing to take part in the follow-on study will be invited to receive a booster dose of AD26.ZEBOV, but this is not a requirement of participation. Blood tests will be taken 7 days and 1 month after AD26.ZEBOV in those receiving the booster dose with this vaccine. All participants having a further blood test at one year after enrolment, allowing us to evaluate the persistence of vaccine induced immunity with and without a late booster dose of AD26.ZEBOV.

Arthropod-borne viral fevers and viral haemorrhagic fevers,A phase I study to determine the safety and immunogenicity of the candidate Zika Virus (ZIKV) vaccine ChAdOx1 Zika in healthy adult volunteers given as a stand alone vaccine or co-administered with the Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV) candidate vaccine ChAdOx1 Chik.,"The purpose of this study is to test a new vaccine against the Zika Virus (ZIKV) in healthy volunteers given on its own and at the same time as another new vaccine against Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV).  Zika is a disease caused by ZIKV and can be transmitted to humans through a mosquito bite, from a pregnant woman to their unborn child and it can also be sexually transmitted. Symptoms of Zika infection include fever, headache, joint & muscle pains, tiredness and skin rashes, but most people wonât have any symptoms at all. The disease is now known to be associated with major neurological complications, especially in new-borns, with lifelong consequences.    It became well-known after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Zika epidemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, following the rapid spread of the disease from Latin America in 2016 where several birth defects were associated with Zika infection. More than 85 countries have now reported Zika cases and the disease continues to spread globally. Zika is now part of the WHO list of priority diseases lists for accelerated vaccine research.    Chikungunya fever is a disease caused by CHIKV and it is transmitted to humans through a mosquito bite. It has been identified in over 100 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, Oceania and the Americas. The disease typically consists of an acute illness characterised by fever, skin rash, muscle aches and severe joint pains (which are often incapacitating), lasting weeks to months or in rare cases, years. CHIKV is listed as priority virus by the UK Vaccine Network and the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. It has also been designated as a serious condition requiring action by the WHO to promote Research and Development to control future outbreaks.    There are currently no available specific treatments or licensed vaccines for any of these 2 diseases. The same type of mosquito is involved in the transmission of ZIKV and CHIKV and strategies tackling the control of the mosquito are extremely difficult to implement. The development of new vaccines is the most cost-effective way to fight Zika and Chikungunya.    The study will enable us to assess the safety of new vaccines called ChAdOx1 Zika and ChAdOx1 Chik and the extent of their immune responses in healthy volunteers. We will do this by giving participants a single dose of either one (Zika) or both vaccines (Zika and Chikungunya), in addition to doing blood tests and collecting information about any symptoms that occur after vaccination. This is the first trial to use this Zika vaccine and the second study to use the Chikungunya vaccine in humans. We plan to recruit a maximum of 66 participants to be vaccinated, where half of them will receive the Zika vaccine only and the other half will receive both vaccines.    Healthy volunteers aged 18-50 will be recruited in Oxford and vaccinated at the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine and will be followed for a period of 12 months. The study is funded by the UK Department of Health & Social Care and Innovate UK.","The volunteer must satisfy all the following criteria to be eligible for the study:  1.

Arthrosis,Safety and Feasibility Evaluation of Tourniquets for Total Knee Replacement Study,The majority of surgeons perform Total Knee Replacement surgery with the aid of a tourniquet. The tourniquet interrupts the blood supply and drainage from the leg and helps to create a bloodless field. A tourniquet may however increase a patientsâ risk of developing a blood clot. At the end of surgery the tourniquet is deflated and blood clots that may have accumulated in the leg are immediately free to flow (embolise) within the blood stream. In some cases blood clots and debris can return to the heart where they are then free to travel to the brain.  The potentially increased risk of clots and debris in the brain associated with using a tourniquet has never been examined with any definitive randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and it is unclear if such a RCT would even be feasible. A feasibility study is therefore planned and will comprise three parts:  i. Pilot randomised controlled trial. Patients due for TKR surgery will invited to take part in a pilot trial and randomised to surgery with or without a tourniquet with a view to recruiting 50 patients. All patients will undergo a Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging scan of their brain before and after surgery to look for evidence of clots and debris in the brain. Other potentially important outcomes including knee pain and function within 12 months will also be collected.  ii. Integrated qualitative research study. An interview study of around 30 patients and around 20 surgeons will capture the views and opinions of both groups regarding the acceptability of the pilot trial.  iii. Retrospective multi-centre cohort study. A study of an existing database of TKR surgery in England and Wales (National Joint Registry-NJR) will be undertaken. The data will be mapped to other existing databases of deaths and hospital reported blood clots.,All patients undergoing an elective primary unilateral cemented total knee replacement (TKR) under the care of four orthopaedic consultants at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire (UHCW) NHS trust are potentially eligible to take part in the pilot RCT.
Arthrosis,The Development of New Classification Criteria for Hand Osteoarthritis,"The purpose of this study is to develop a new criteria for distinguishing patients with hand osteoarthritis from other  conditions based on their symptoms and/or x-ray findings. This is a multi-center international study. 200 participants  older than 18 years in age, 100 with hand osteoarthritis and 100 with hand complaints not due to osteoarthritis will be  recruited in nine hospitals worldwide. Twenty-four participants will be recruited in Nottingham, UK. Patients will attend  for a single visit at which they will give information about their joint symptoms, and have examination of their joints.  Blood tests for measuring inflammation and hand radiographs will be performed if this has not been done in the  previous six months. Photograph of both hands will be taken. We anticipate the study visit to take approximately one  hour. The patients' symptoms will be scored on a 1 to 10 scale by a rheumatologist as to whether they are related to  hand osteoarthritis or not. Once data from all participating centers is collected, it will be sent to the main study center  for analysis so that symptoms, signs and x-ray and blood test changes that can differentiate patients with hand  osteoarthritis from other conditions will be identified. Only anonymised information will be sent to the main study  center.     Logistic regression analyses with limited numbers of predictors evaluating which clinical features (independent  variables) discriminate between OA and not OA (dependent variable) using data from 50 patients. A list of potentially  relevant features and categories within each feature for classifying an individual as having (or not having) hand OA will  be developed. The 1000Minds software (www.1000Minds.com) will be used to develop a weighting scheme for these  features with the goal of identifying a set of criteria that provide a range of probability (from 0 to 100%) of hand OA.","Age â¥18 years   Hand symptoms e.g. pain with or without stiffness, restriction of movement due to arthritis for at least six weeks   Diagnosed with OA of hands or any other arthritis affecting their hands   Ability to give informed consent"
Arthrosis,WHISTL:ER. Follow up of hip arthroplasty long term:Effect on Revision,"After a hip replacement, some patients are offered long term follow up of their new joint and others are not.   A follow  up is offered to check the joint for any sign of potential failure.   Many patients appreciate the reassurance but it is not  known if this service, hip arthroplasty surveillance, has any effect on the outcome when a revision of the hip  replacement is needed.   This is a pilot study to examine the effect of hip arthroplasty surveillance on the patient  reported outcome and the cost to the health service after revision of a hip replacement.  The group of patients who will be asked to participate are those about to have an operation to revise a hip  replacement.   It will not include those patients who have an infection in their hip joint.   It will take place in one large  orthopaedic unit over a twelve month period.   Each participant will be asked to complete a questionnaire before they  have their operation, six months after their operation and twelve months after the operation.   Information from the  medical records and from the questionnaires will be used to answer the study question.

Arthrosis,Multi -Centre Clinical Study Comparing the Clinical and Patient Reported   Outcomes of the Vanguard XP Knee System to the Vanguard CR Knee System,"Knee replacement surgery is a common treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee. There are  different types of knee replacement systems, or âimplantsâ, that can be used in the surgery. The  research looking at modifications and design changes to these implants is limited. Research is  needed to consider the changing characteristics of the patients who require knee surgery.  Currently there is an increase in demand for knee replacement in a younger and more active  population, who desire less limitation on their activities following knee replacement surgery.  Current knee replacement designs sacrifice one of the main ligaments in the knee, called the  Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL). By preserving natural knee structures, such as the ACL, it is  thought that the knee will retain more normal function following surgery.  The Vanguard CR is a commonly used knee replacement, and it sacrifices the ACL. Zimmer  Biomet have developed a new knee replacement implant called the Vanguard XP which keeps all  the main knee ligaments intact. This new design may benefit the younger, more active  population.  ALLIKAT is a research study which will evaluate the early outcomes of the Vanguard XP  compared to the Vanguard CR. Patients will be followed up for 3 years, with information about  complications both during and following the surgery, as well as patient reported outcomes. 200  patients will be randomised to receive either the Vanguard CR or the Vanguard XP, and they will  not know which one they receive. There will also be a smaller group of 60 participants who will  only receive the Vanguard XP. The data from this cohort group will contribute to safety and  efficacy evaluation of the new implant. 260 patients will be recruited in total from 5-6 NHS sites  around the UK.  Non-identifiable data collected from the cohort group combined with the data from those  randomised to the Vanguard XP will contribute to the Beyond Compliance Program which has  been set up in the interest of patients, to support the safe and stepwise introduction of new or  modified medical implants such as joint replacements.",Primary Osteoarthritis of the knee involving one or more compartments of the joint  Intact Anterior and Posterior Cruciate Ligaments  Intact collateral ligaments  Correctable coronal deformity  No more than 15 degrees of fixed flexion deformity
Arthrosis,A Longitudinal study investigating whether Patient Reported Outcome Measures at day of discharge and 3-weeks Post  Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) predict outcomes at 12-months post-operatively?,"Title: Early PROMPT Study  Background Approximately 20% of patients are not satisfied after Total knee replacement (Wylde et al, 2011). However,  it remains a challenge to reliably identify the candidates who will do well and who will not following TKA (Lungu et al,  2014a). Studies which have looked at the predictive value of pre-operative factors have not been able to establish clear  guidelines on this issue (Desmeules et al, 2013, Lungu et al 2014b, Wylde et al, 2007). Post-operatively, it appears  the first 12-week period is a critical phase of recovery as pain, function and satisfaction studies have shown that persistent problems remaining at 12-weeks post-operatively are predictive of problems at 1 year (Mitsuyasu et al,  2011Í¾ Williams et al, 2013).   Very few studies have analysed whether there are factors present in the first 6-weeks post  op, which reliably predict long term outcomes. Logically, the earlier patients at risk of problems are identified, the more  chance there is to provide interventions which reduce the negative impact of them (Williams et al, 2013).  Purpose: This study is aiming to identify whether variables at day of discharge and 3-weeks post TKA predict  outcomes at 1 year post-operatively.   Methods: 200 patients will be consented at their pre-operative appointment and then seen on their day of discharge  from Hospital following Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty to complete the Outcome Measures Booklet. They will be given  an extra copy with to take home with them. At 3-weeks post-opÍ¾ the patient will be phoned to remind them to return the  booklet.

Arthrosis,Osteoarthritis Thumb Therapy trial. A randomised controlled trial into the effectiveness and efficacy of splints in thumb base osteoarthritis.,"Symptomatic thumb base OA affects 20% of the population over 55 years, causing more pain, work disability, reduced  quality of life and function than OA elsewhere in the hand. International experts recommend splinting for hand OA but  there is limited evidence from robust trials to support this.    OTTER II is a multicentre, single blind, randomised controlled clinical effectiveness and efficacy trial. Occupational  therapy and physiotherapy centres in England will recruit participants aged 30 years and over with clinical thumb base  OA. People with symptomatic thumb base OA and moderate to severe thumb base pain will be allocated to either 8  weeks of self-managementÍ¾ 8 weeks of self-management plus a verum splint, or 8 weeks of self-management plus a  sham splint. Follow up will be for 12 weeks from baseline.The primary outcome is the AUSCAN hand pain scale. The  study end point is 8 weeks. Outcomes will be collected at baselineÍ¾ 4 weeksÍ¾ 8 weeksÍ¾ and 12 weeks. Findings will  improve the management of thumb base OA and add to understanding contextual aspects of rehabilitation and selfmanagement  strategies for OA.    The study design builds on experience of conducting the OTTER pilot study and the practical implications for  supporting clinicians across the UK to recruit into and deliver a fully powered randomised control effectiveness and  efficacy trial. This design is a straightforward pragmatic design that will be able to be supported by NHS out-patient  clinics and associated booking procedures throughout the NHS.

Arthrosis,"Enhancing the credibility, usefulness and relevance of patient experience data in services for people with long-term  physical and mental health conditions using digital data capture and improved analysis of narrative data","Background: Information about the experience of patients when they use NHS services is already collected using  patient surveys. Staff often think these surveys are not useful, as people have to remember what they thought about a  service they used in the past. Collecting feedback using mobile phones or tablets straight after a service is used may  be better. Patients often write detailed comments about their experiences on surveys, but these are often not used as  staff cannot read through them all. Some services record patient stories to help staff improve services. However, there  has been little research on the best ways to collect, analyse, and use these sorts of data to best improve the NHS.    The study asks: can we make data about patient experience of NHS services easier to collect, and more useful, by  improving the way we analyse and present this data?    There are 4 parts to our study.  1 Can we improve collection of data to help people provide timely, personalised feedback on NHS services in ways  that are useful to staff?  We will talk to patients to find out their views on collection of data on patient experience. Working with patients, we will  design new and effective ways to collect data on patient experience, through writing, audio or video. We will talk to  health staff and their managers about how they would want this data presented so they can best use it.  2 Can we improve the analysis of patient comments and stories (so called ânarrative dataâ)?  We will use computer science methods (known as âtext-miningâ) to analyse patient comments and stories quickly and  effectively. We will see how patient comments and stories relate to other measures the NHS collects on quality, safety  and outcomes.  3 Can we design a toolkit that helps NHS staff collect, analyse and use data on patient experience?  Working alongside patients and staff, we will bring data together from our earlier work to help us design training,  guidance and computer tools to help patients and staff collect data, analyse it, and use it in ways that are useful and  make a difference to NHS services.  4 Does the introduction of the toolkit into the NHS improve collection, analysis and presentation of data on patient  experience?  We will get services to use the toolkit, and talk to patients and staff to see if the toolkit has made a difference in the way  that data on patient experience is collected, analysed,and used to improve NHS services for patients. We will see how  much time and effort staff have to put in to use the toolkit, which will help us understand the costs and benefits  involved.    The project will focus on two groups of patients: those with serious mental illness (such as schizophrenia), and those  with musculoskeletal conditions (such as arthritis). These groups are similar in some ways: they use lots of different  NHS services, face difficulties in seeing the same staff at different appointments, and can be at risk of harm when  services do not work well. However, these patients groups also differ in their age and the types of problems that they  face. By looking at both groups, we will be better able to understand how to improve patient experience in specific  groups of patients, and also how to make the results relevant to other patient groups across the NHS.    We will conduct the research in 3 sites: a rheumatology outpatient department in Salford, a community mental health  team in Manchester, and two general practices in the North West.","Staff participants will be drawn from:  i) clinical staff, managers and IT staff working within rheumatology outpatients in Salford Royal Foundation Trust,  ii) clinical staff, managers and IT staff working within a community mental health team within Manchester Mental  Health & Social Care Trust  iii) primary care staff in two general practices within Salford CCG.   Patient participants:  i) patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis who attend the Rheumatology Outpatients department at SRFT.  ii) patients diagnosed with a serious mental illness living in the community who receive support from MMHSCT staff.  iii) patients with either a musculoskeletal condition or serious mental health problem attending one of 2 participating  primary care sites within Salford CCG.    Carer participants:  i) carers of service users suffering with MSK or SMI from one of the 3 sites listed above.  Participants will be over 18 yrs of age. There is no upper age limit.     The study does not have the capacity to focus specifically on people who are unable to speak or understand English  language. However, where possible, we will seek to include people who may have some difficulties communicating  (verbal or written) in English in order to consider issues faced for such people in giving feedback on their experiences  of services. This may require us to seek input from a translator for a small number of interviews, and we will seek to  accommodate this where applicable. We will take steps to include patients with disabilities wherever possible for  example, larger font patient information for the visually impaired or a live typed conversation option for the deaf  community."
Arthrosis,Skeletal Muscle and Adipose Cross Talk: Identifying novel mediators of inflammation and cellular metabolism.,"Lay title: The role of muscle and fat Cross Talk in joint damage    Background: Recent studies have shown that certain naturally occurring substances in the body can cause damage to our joints. These substances include ""adipokines"" that are released from joint fat tissue, and ""myokines"" that are released by joint skeletal muscle tissue. Several of these adipokines and myokines are thought to cause problems with the regulation of inflammation and metabolism, which in turn can contribute to joint damage in conditions such as osteoarthritis (OA).    Aim of the study: We will examine the interaction, also called ""cross-talk"", between muscle, fat and joint tissue from patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery in order to identify new targets for therapeutic intervention.    Study design: We will recruit a total of 1256 patients aged 35-85 who are undergoing orthopaedic surgery who are either normal weight, overweight or obese and either male or female who have different anatomical arthritis.    We will compare the groups for the following outcome measures: Height and weight, waist and hip circumference, blood pressure (physical assessment); Inflammation (blood test); body's response to sugar and insulin (metabolic blood test); Joint damage (physical assessment, routine x-ray, blood test); Function of adipokines and myokines (tissue analysis); Cross-talk between muscle, fat and joint tissue, and its impact on the joint (tissue analysis).    Outcome: We will determine the role of adipokines and myokines in controlling inflammation and metabolism, and in causing damage to the joint. By identifying how the cross-talk between muscle, fat and joint tissue affect the joint, we could identify a site of action for a drug (called a drug target) to prevent or slow down the progression of joint damage","Patients (male or female) who are undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery (age 35 - 85) on their knee, hip, spine, hand and wrist, shoulder, elbow, ankle and foot."
Arthrosis,Cloudy with a Chance of Pain,"Cloudy with a Chance of Pain is a large population study and citizen science experiment to investigate the association between weather and pain-related symptoms in people with arthritis and other chronic pain.    For centuries people have speculated about whether there is a relationship between the weather and pain, and if so, what the nature of this relationship is. However, researchers have been unable to reach any firm conclusions due to studies having small sample sizes and poor quality data. Using participantsâ own smartphones, Cloudy with a Chance of Pain collects self-reported daily symptoms and whilst pull weather data from the closest weather station using the phone's GPS.      The study is being conducted in collaboration with two partner organisations: uMotif, one of the UKâs leading digital health companies, with software for health self management; and The Office for Creative Research, a multidisciplinary research group dedicated to new modes of engagement with data through unique practices that borrow from both the arts and sciences.     The project has already secured University Research Ethics Committee approval and the approval of grant funders Arthritis Research UK. The application for funding was reviewed by six peer reviewers external to the study.  The project was officially launched on January 20 2016 and has to date successfully recruited over 12,000 participants.","- Participants should be aged 17 years and older (there is no upper age limit).    - Male and female participants.    - Participants should have arthritis or other chronic pain (lasting for 3 months or more).    - Participants require access to a smartphone, iOS or Android compatible"
Arthrosis,Correlates of sedentary behaviour and physical activity in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Osteoarthritis (OA),"Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is recommended for people with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and lower limb Osteoarthritis (OA) in order to improve physical and psychological health, as well as to reduce the joint pain, disease-related inflammation, and associated physical dysfunction symptomatic of these conditions. However, the physical dysfunction resulting from RA and OA also means that most individuals living with these conditions do not engage in sufficient levels of MVPA to experience these health benefits.     Reducing sedentary behaviour (e.g., time spent sitting, lying) may be perceived as more manageable than increasing MVPA for people with RA and OA. Recent studies in older adults have suggested that reducing sedentary behaviour might help to improve physical function, enhance psychological health, and lessen systemic inflammation. Importantly, the positive health benefits of reducing sedentary behaviour are reported to occur regardless of levels of MVPA participation.     Currently, we know little about the physical and psychological health implications of sedentary behaviour for RA and OA, as well as factors predictive of both sedentary time and MVPA engagement. In addition, we do not know if the possible health implications of sedentary behaviour are independent from the health benefits of MVPA engagement for these individuals.    The primary aim of this research is therefore to investigate (and compare) the determinants and health consequences of objectively measured MVPA and sedentary behaviour in RA and OA. The research will be conducted at Russells Hall Hospital (Dudley). Patients who consent will be asked to participate in 2 âstudy weeksâ, 6 months apart. At the start and end of each study week, participants will be asked to complete questionnaires, provide a fasted blood sample (RA only), and undertake assessments of height, weight, body composition, and blood pressure. Participants will also be given an accelerometer to wear for 7 days during the study week.","Rheumatoid Arthritis:   1. Patients must be clinically diagnosed with RA (ACR Clinical Classification Criteria; Aletaha et al., 2010).  2. Aged 18 years old and above.    Osteoarthritis:   1. Adults above 45 years of age.  2. Physician-made diagnosis of hip or knee OA regardless of radiographic evidence (confirmed by the consultant or research nurse who will introduce the study to the participant)."
Arthrosis,Hip Osteoarthritis treatment using Autologous Stem cell Therapy (HOAST),"We aim to investigate whether the use of stem cells taken from a patients own body for the treatment of early osteoarthritis of the hip is superior to current surgical treatment options by way of a randomized controlled trial comparing the two. Previously, the only way to surgically treat hip OA was with a joint replacement, but more and more research is being undertaken to find new ways to treat osteoarthritis earlier on in a less invasive manner, to reduce the morbidity and cost associated with the treatment of osteoarthritis. Currently, our best surgical treatment (best chondral therapy for early OA is with hip arthroscopy (key hole surgery) and microfracture, where small holes are drilled into the damaged cartilage of the hip joint to promote bleeding and scar tissue formation to form a new joint surface. We want to see if the use of stem cells, taken from a patients bone marrow in their hip at the time of surgery and then applied to the damaged cartilage surface via key hole surgery, along with microfracture, gives better results than just microfracture alone. We will be performing a smaller pilot study in order to determine the size of a full follow up study based on the results we get. This pilot will involve 40 patients, with half randomized to each treatment option (best chondral therapy vs stem cell therapy plus best chondral therapy). The patients will be adults aged 18-75 years with early osteoarthritis and no prior medical hip issues. These will be patients who were already planning on having best chondral therapy. The study will take place over 2 sites, The Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre and The Manor Hospital in Oxford. We predict the pilot phase of the study to take 1 year and the follow up study to take 2 years to complete.","â¢ Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the trial.   â¢ Male of female, aged 18 to 75 years   â¢ Diagnosed with focal, early hip osteoarthritis Kellgren-Lawrence Grade < 2 on preoperative imaging and Outerbridge score greater than 0.   â¢ Female participants of child bearing potential and male participants whose partner is of child bearing potential must be willing to ensure that they or their partner use effective contraception during the trial and for 3 months thereafter.   â¢ In the Investigatorâs opinion, is able and willing to comply with all trial requirements.   â¢ Willing to allow his or her General Practitioner and consultant, if appropriate, to be notified of participation in the trial."
Arthrosis,"The role of hospital organisation, surgical factors, and the enhanced recovery pathway on patient outcomes and NHS costs following primary hip and knee replacement surgery: spatial and longitudinal analysis of routine data","Over 160,000 people with severe hip or knee pain caused by osteoarthritis have joint replacement surgery each year in the NHS, and this number is expected to increase. We know that there are geographical variations in the uptake of common surgical procedures including hip and knee replacement. A recent study found evidence of significant unexplained variation among hospitals in both health outcomes and resource use following hip and knee replacement, but little is known about why such variation exists, or the factors that contribute to this. The aim of the Atlas study is to understand how, and in which ways, the enhanced recovery pathway through hip and knee replacement surgery is implemented across different hospital settings, and to find out about health professionalsâ and patientsâ experiences of this. The specific objectives of the study are (i) to understand the different ways in which the enhanced recovery pathway is used in practice across four different hospital settings and (ii) to understand the organisational processes that help or hinder implementation of the enhanced recovery pathway in four settings. The sites include a teaching hospital, a district general hospital, a specialist orthopaedic hospital and an independent sector treatment centre. A qualitative researcher will spend three intensive one-week phases of fieldwork in each hospital between October 2016 and July 2017. The researcher will âshadowâ aspects of professionalsâ everyday work, and will interview 15-20 professionals and 10-15 patients at each site. Eligible participants will be patients undergoing joint replacement surgery, who are aged 18+, and able to give informed consent, and staff involved in delivering care and treatment to patients undergoing joint replacement.",Staff inclusion criteria   â¢ Health professionals involved in delivering all aspects of care to patients undergoing joint replacement     Patient inclusion criteria   â¢ Age 18+   â¢ Undergoing hip or knee replacement   â¢ Able and willing to give informed consent
Arthrosis,Outcomes of Bologna-Oxford (BOX) Total Ankle Replacement (TAR) â A Single Centre Prospective Observational Cohort Study,"Total ankle replacement helps to improve pain and ankle movement in patients with ankle arthritis. Current prosthetic designs use a three part uncemented ankle joint which has shown encouraging results. The BOX total ankle system is a third generation TAR design which has been designed to provide physiological stability and to achieve accurate positioning of the prosthesis to support the ligaments around the ankle. This implant was starting to be used in the UK since 2008 and so far, over 300 BOX ankle systems have been implanted last year. The aim of our study is to collect comprehensive information on how well this ankle system performs for a total ankle replacement. This will be done by taking X-rays to look at the implant, asking questions about ankle pain and physical activity, measuring the quality of bone, ankle examination and after the surgery and measuring walking patterns and physical activity before and after the operation.","Patients with end stage ankle arthritis, who are listed to undergo a primary TAR at Freeman Hospital will be invited to  participate in the study."
